Since Brad is moving to Santa Cruz this month, I'll be hosting South Bay Vegan Drinks for awhile.

It was the sweetest birthday present anyone could have ever given me!

Here are the details.

Where: [Mission Creek Brewing Company](http://www.yelp.com/biz/mission-creek-brewing-co-san-jose)

When: May 27, 2015 from 6:30-9pm (southbay vegan drinks is always on the last Wednesday of the month)

What: Vegan dinner and drinks

Why: For now, just to meet other vegans, but in the future, hopefully to learn more about vegan businesses, activism, and events in the bay area.

Here's some pictures of some of the people who came in May.
