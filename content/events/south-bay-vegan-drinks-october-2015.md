I'm sad to say that this will be my last month organizing Vegan Drinks. It made me really happy to grow it from 15 attendees to 70 in just 6 short months, but I must move on to bigger and better things (like my [new podcast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnK9ShI0B4IBEsRK865sgQQ) and the [Vegan Prom](https://bayareasoiree.wordpress.com/)). The event will still continue with a new organizer (the next 2 dates will be November 19 and December 17). Here are some pictures and details from October's event.
