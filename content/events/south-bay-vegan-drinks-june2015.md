June 25 was my 2nd month hosting South Bay Vegan Drinks, and it was sooooo fun!!!

The new venue ([The Fountainhead Bar](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-fountainhead-bar-san-jose)) is super cute inside, and the craft cocktails are delicious!

The sweet and savory cones by [Raw Daddy's](http://www.rawdaddyfoods.com/)&nbsp;were perfect in every way - cute, delicious, gluten-free, and vegan.

Here's a picture of the menus I made with the drink specials for this month.
