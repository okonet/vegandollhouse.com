#### Vegan Gluten-free Chocolate Cupcake ingredients:

- 1 ⅔ c coconut-almond milk
- 1 T apple cider vinegar
- ½ c sunflower or coconut oil
- 1 ¼ c organic evaporated cane juice
- 1 T vanilla extract
- ¼ t almond extract
- ½ c tapioca flour
- 3 T ground flax seeds (I use a coffee grinder)
- ½ c almond flour
- ½ c rice flour
- ½ c quinoa flour
- ⅓ c fava-chickpea flour
- ½ c cocoa powder
- ½ T baking powder

#### Vegan Gluten-free Chocolate Cupcake directions:

**Mix** all the wet ingredients together (including sugar).

**Sift** the dry ingredients together.

**Add** the dry ingredients to the wet, mixing well.

**Fill** the cupcake papers 80% full. This should make around 15 cupcakes (12 to take to the party and 3 to keep for yourself--oink oink).

**Bake** &nbsp;the cupcake for 21-24 minutes or until you insert a toothpick into the center and it comes out clean.





#### Peanut Butter filling/icing ingredients:

- ½ c&nbsp;earth balance
- ½ c spectrum palm shortening
- ½ c peanut butter
- 2 T molasses
- ⅛ c&nbsp;non-dairy milk (you may not need it all, but have it ready, just in case)
- 1 T&nbsp;vanilla extract
- 3 c organic powdered sugar



#### Peanut Butter filling/icing directions:

**Whisk** &nbsp;all the ingredients, except the powdered sugar, together using an electric mixer.

**Sift** in powdered sugar one cup at a time.

**Pipe** icing into the center of the cupcakes as well as on top of the cupcakes.

\*Peanut Butter cups are super easy to make if you have mini silicone cupcake cups, chocolate chips, and peanut butter. Here's what they looked like when they came out of the freezer.
