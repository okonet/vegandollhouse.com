This recipe makes 6 donuts. Featured on [Finding Vegan](http://www.findingvegan.com/cinnamoroll-donuts/).

#### Cinnamoroll Donut ingredients:

- 1 cup unbleached flour
- ¾ cup sugar
- 1 t baking powder
- 1 t cinnamon
- ¼ t nutmeg
- ¼ t salt
- 1 egg replacer (I use Ener-G)
- 5 oz almond milk (or sub any non-dairy milk)
- 1 T sunflower oil (or sub any vegetable oil)
- 1 t vanilla extract

#### Cinnamoroll Donut directions:

**Preheat** the oven to 350°.

**Whisk** the dry ingredients together (the first 6 ingredients).

**Whisk** the wet ingredients together (the last 4 ingredients).

**Lightly** oil a donut pan.

**Combine** the wet ingredients with the dry, but only until you don't see any visible flour (don't overmix).

**Spoon** the batter into the donut pan.

**Bake** at 350° for 20 minutes (or for 12 minutes if they're mini donuts).

**Cool** for 15 minutes before carefully removing from pan with a silicone spatula.

#### White Chocolate Coating ingredients:

- 4 oz cacao butter (food-grade)
- 1-2 c organic powdered sugar (only use as much as you need to achieve a piping consistency)

#### White Chocolate Coating directions:

**Melt** the cacao butter in a small saucepan on low heat.

**Remove** the pan from heat once it's a liquid.

**Whisk** in sifted powdered sugar a quarter cup at a time.

**Transfer** to a piping bag fitted with a small round writing tip once the white chocolate is thick enough to pipe.

**Draw** &nbsp;at least 12 ears on a parchment-paper-covered cutting board with piping bag. I usually draw a few more than I will need in case some break.

**Transfer** the ears to the freezer to harden. Remove them only when they have become stiff (see picture below).

**Pipe** the remaining white chocolate onto the tops of the donuts and let sit.

#### Cinnamoroll Facial Features ingredients:

- light blue decorating icing (or you can make your own blue buttercream frosting like I did)
- pink edible glitter or cake sparkles

#### Cinnamoroll Facial Features directions:

**Draw** the eyes and mouth with blue icing on all 6 donuts.

**Add** cheeks by dabbing edible glitter or cake sparkles on with your finger. You can also use pink decorating icing or pink sprinkles for the cheeks, but I used pink cake sparkles from Wilton.

**Cut** slits into each side of the donuts where you want to insert the ears.

**Remove** the ears from the freezer. You have to work quickly on this step in order to keep the ears from melting. If they start to melt, I suggest returning them to the freezer for a minute or 2 in between donuts.
