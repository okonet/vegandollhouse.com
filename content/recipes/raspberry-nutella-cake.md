#### Vegan Gluten-free Chocolate Cake Ingredients:

- 1 ½&nbsp;c coconut-almond milk (or sub any nondairy milk)
- 1 T apple cider vinegar
- ½ c sunflower, safflower, or coconut oil
- 1 ¼ c organic evaporated cane juice (or sub coconut sugar)
- 1 T vanilla extract
- ¼ t almond extract
- ½ c tapioca flour
- 3 T ground flax seeds (I use a coffee grinder)
- ½ c almond flour
- ½ c rice flour
- ½ c millet flour
- ⅓ c fava-chickpea flour
- ½ c cocoa powder
- 2 ½ T baking powder
- 1 t baking soda



#### Vegan Gluten-free Chocolate Cake Directions:

**Preheat** the oven to 350°.

**Mix** all the wet ingredients together (including sugar).

**Sift** the dry ingredients together.

**Add** the dry ingredients to the wet, mixing only until incorporated, but not overmixing.

**Grease** 3 mini cake pans.

**Fill** the cake pans 75% full. This should make a 3-layer mini cake for 6 people, or a 2-layer cake for 4 people with a 1-layer cake to keep for yourself (oink oink).

**Bake** &nbsp;the cakes for 26-30 minutes or until you insert a toothpick into the center and it comes out clean. The cake pans should be as centered in the oven as possible, and try not to open the oven dorr at all while baking or they may not rise properly.





#### Nutella Mousse Ingredients:

- 1 package firm silken tofu (wrapped in a towel for a few minutes)
- ¼ c agave (you can substitute maple syrup)
- ¼ c coconut sugar (you can substitute evaporated cane juice)
- ⅓ c almond milk (you can use any nondairy milk.)
- ⅔ c&nbsp;[Justin's chocolate hazelnut butter](http://justins.com/item/chocolate-hazelnut-butter/) (There are other companies that make vegan nutella, but this one is my favorite.)
- 1 c chocolate (I buy the semi-sweet chocolate chips at Trader Joe's because they're cheap, but you can use any kind of vegan chocolate.)



#### Nutella Mousse Directions:

**Blend** the tofu, hazelnut butter, almond milk, agave, and coconut sugar until it's smooth and creamy.

**Melt** &nbsp;the chocolate in a double boiler (or just in a saucepan on low heat), stirring occasionally.

**Add** &nbsp;the melted chocolate to the blender, scrape the sides, and blend again until it's smooth and creamy.

**Chill** &nbsp;the mousse in the fridge for 2-3 hours or overnight.

**Spread** &nbsp;the mousse over the top of cake layer 1. Repeat with second (and optional third) cake layer. Cover the top and sides with nutella mousse.

**Set** &nbsp;aside the remainder.





#### Raspberry Buttercream Frosting Ingredients:

- ¼ c&nbsp;earth balance
- ¼ c spectrum palm shortening
- 1 container fresh raspberries
- 1 T&nbsp;vanilla extract
- 2 c organic powdered sugar



#### Raspberry Buttercream Frosting Directions:

**Mash** &nbsp;around half the berries using a mortar and pestle (after picking out the prettiest ones for garnishing).

**Whisk** &nbsp;all the ingredients, except the powdered sugar, together using an electric mixer.

**Sift** in powdered sugar ½ cup at a time.

**Fill** &nbsp;one piping bag with remaining nutella mousse, and another with raspberry buttercream frosting.

**Pipe** icing in in any pattern you like.

**Garnish** with remaining raspberries.
