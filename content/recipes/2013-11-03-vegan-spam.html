          <h4><span>Ingredients:</span></h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1/4 c braggs liquid aminos</li>
<li>1/4 c olive oil</li>
<li>1/4 t liquid smoke or hickory smoke salt</li>
<li>1 block extra firm tofu</li>
</ul>
<h4>Directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Slice</strong> X-firm tofu as thin as possible without it breaking, and use a small cookie cutter to cut out your shape of choice. I made hearts. You layer them in between layers of paper towels for a few minutes to wick the moisture out of them. </p>
<p><span><span><strong>Make</strong> a delicious spamlike marinade by combining the 1/4 c olive oil, the 1/4 c braggs liquid aminos, and the 1/4 t hickory smoke. Then brush it onto the bottom of a glass pyrex baking pan.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Lay</strong> each piece of tofu into the pyrex pan as closely together as possible so you can fit them all.</p>
<p><strong>Brush</strong> the tops of the tofu pieces with the marinade using a pastry or silicone brush. If you don&#39;t have a brush, you can just use your hands and a spoon.</p>

<p><strong>Bake</strong> the tofu in the oven (~350˚) for 20 minutes, and then flip them all over. Brush marinade over the other side. Bake for another 20 minutes. Cool.</p>
