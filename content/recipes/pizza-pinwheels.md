#### Pizza Dough Ingredients:

- 2 tablespoons yeast
- 2 cups warm water (I use around 110 degree water)
- 2 teaspoons raw sugar
- 5 cups flour
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 2-4 tablespoons nutritional yeast
- extra flour for dusting rolling surface

#### Pizza Dough Directions:

**Mix** the yeast, water, and sugar in large bowl. Add 3 cups of the flour. Mix well to blend. (I use my kitchenaid for this because kneading dough is my nemesis.)

**Add** the oil, salt, garlic, nutritional yeast, and remaining flour and stir well.

**Place** the dough to a flour covered board. Dust your hands with flour. Knead for 5 minutes, adding flour if it gets too sticky. (Or, do this with your kitchenaid.)

**Roll** dough into a ball and place into a lightly oiled bowl. Cover bowl with towel and set in a warm place for 45 minutes to rise.

#### Pizza Pinwheels Ingredients:

- olive oil
- pizza sauce (I usually mix one 15 oz can of organic tomato sauce with one 6 oz can of organic tomato paste, and then I add basil, oregano, and garlic)
- 1 package grated nondairy cheese (I use follow your heart mozarella)
- Any other pizza ingredients you like, cut into very small pieces

#### Pizza Pinwheels Directions:

**Preheat** the oven to 350°.

**Line** 2 cookies sheets with parchment paper or sprinkle cornmeal onto a baking stone.

**Divide** the dough into 2 equal sized pieces.

**Roll** out one section of dough into a rectangle, flouring your surface and your rolling pin before starting.

**Brush** the surface with olive oil.

**Spread** a thin layer of pizza sauce on your dough.

**Add** the toppings one-by-one, but don't overload it, and make sure you chop your toppings into small pieces.

**Roll** slowly and gently, starting with the long end and working your way from one end to the other and back again.

**Repeat** the above instructions for the second roll, and when you place it in the fridge to chill, remove roll #1.

**Place** the first roll onto a cutting board and cut into one-inch slices.

**Place** the pinwheels onto a baking sheet, leaving space in between each one for room to grow.

**Repeat** with roll #2.

**Sprinkle** the tops with seasonings (optional).

**Bake** for 20-25 minutes or until they start to brown.

**Serve** with the remaining pizza sauce to dip into.
