#### Vegan Coconut Cupcake Ingredients:

- 2 c flour
- 1 t baking soda
- 1 t baking powder
- ½ t salt
- 2 c shredded coconut
- ⅔ c coconut oil
- 2 T lemon zest
- 1 ½ c sugar
- 2 c coconut milk
- ½ c soymilk
- 1 T vanilla extract
- 1 T apple cider vinegar



#### Vegan Coconut Cupcake Directions:

**Preheat** the oven to 350° and melt the coconut oil in the oven while it's preheating.

**Line** 2 muffin pans with ~18 paper liners.

**Combine** vinegar and soymilk and let sit. In another bowl, sift the flour, soda, powder, and salt.

**Add** oil, sugar, lemon zest, and vanilla to the soymilk mixture and stir well. Sift dry ingredients into the wet and mix until smooth.

**Add** the coconut and mix until incorporated.

**Fill** the baking cups about ⅔&nbsp;full.

**Bake** for 24 minutes, until when you insert a toothpick into the center of one, it comes out clean.



#### Vegan Coconut Icing Ingredients:

- ½ cup earth balance or homemade vegan butter
- ½ cup organic palm shortening
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 3 cups organic powdered sugar
- 2 cups organic shredded coconut, blended until fine
- 1 package of speculoos cookies (I get mine from Trader Joe's)



#### Vegan Coconut Icing Directions:

**Whisk** the earth balance, palm shortening, and vanilla using a handheld mixer or stand mixer with the whisk attachment.

**Sift** in powdered sugar, a cup at a time, adding a tablespoon of non-dairy milk periodically if needed.

**Add** blended coconut and mix well.

**Spoon** onto cooled cupcakes. I used an ice cream scoop to help make them round.

**Grate** speculoos cookies on the edges to make them rounded like ears.

#### Vegan Pink Icing and Chocolate Eyes Ingredients:

- ½ cup cacao butter, melted on low on stovetop
- ½ cup coconut oil, melted on low on stovetop
- ½ to 1 cup powdered sugar
- red food coloring (I used color garden)
- ½&nbsp;package of vegan chocolate chips



#### Vegan Pink Icing and Chocolate Eyes Directions:

**Melt** a half bag of vegan chocolate chips in a double boiler or in a small pot on low heat.

**Transfer** melted chocolate to a squeeze bottle or piping bag fitted with a small round tip (or you can always use a baggie with the cornet cut off to make a hole).

**Draw** eyes onto parchment paper laid over a cutting board or plate.

**Clear** out a shelf in your fridge and one in your freezer.

**Place** eyes in your freezer to harden.

**Whisk** &nbsp;the icing ingredients together over medium heat until it's completely melted and reaches the desired consistency and color.

**Remove** from heat, dip the cookies into the icing and poke them into the cupcakes.

**Place** the cupcakes into the fridge for the icing to harden.

**Remove** the cupcakes from the fridge to spoon or brush the icing to make My Melody's hood.

**Place** the cupcakes into the fridge for the icing to harden.

**Remove** the cupcakes from the fridge to carefully apply the eyes. (I had to remove the eyes one-by-one from the freezer to do this, since they're so thin, they start to melt the second they make contact with your warm fingers.)

**Return** the cupcakes to the fridge until they're ready to be served.
