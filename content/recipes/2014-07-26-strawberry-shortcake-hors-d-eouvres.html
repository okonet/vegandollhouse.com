<h4>Shortcake ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 c flour</li>
<li>1 T baking powder</li>
<li><span><span>¼</span> t salt</span></li>
<li><span><span>5 T </span>cold coconut oil or earth balance</span></li>
<li>5 T sugar</li>
<li>1 c non-dairy milk</li>
</ul>
<h4>Shortcake directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Preheat</strong> the oven to 400<span>°.</span></p>
<p><strong>Using</strong> the dough hook, combine the dry ingredients in the kitchenaid.</p>
<p><strong>Cut</strong> in the earth balance or coconut oil little pieces at a time and mix until crumbly.</p>
<p><strong>Slowly</strong> add the non-dairy milk while mixing until all the dough forms a nice tight ball.</p>
<p><strong>Place</strong> the dough on a lightly floured cutting board or counter and roll it to <span>½</span> inch thickness.</p>
<p><strong>Cut</strong> out shapes using a cookie cutter.</p>

<p><strong>Line</strong> 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper.</p>
<p><strong>Place</strong> the cut dough pieces gently onto the cookie sheets.</p>

<p><strong>Bake</strong> for 10-20 minutes, depending on the size of your biscuits. I baked mine for only 10 minutes, because they were babies.</p>
<p><strong>Remove</strong> from the oven and transfer to cooling racks.</p>

<h4>Whipped Cream ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cans of coconut cream (I buy mine from Trader Joe&#39;s, but unfortunately, it&#39;s not organic.)</li>
<li>2 T vanilla</li>
<li><span>½ </span>c powdered sugar</li>
<li>½ t xantham gum</li>
</ul>

<h4>Whipped Cream directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Whisk</strong> the ingredients until smooth in the kitchenaid.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer</strong> into piping bag fitted with tip of choice.</p>
<p><strong>Chill</strong> bag overnight if you&#39;re planning to pipe it like I am.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To assemble, I just piped a dollop of whipped cream onto each biscuit. Then I took a cute toothpick, poked a strawberry slice, and then poked the rest of the toothpick into the biscuit topped with whipped cream.</p>

<p>If you have to transport these after you make them (like to the patio of a nearby bar), I suggest bringing a friend to volunteer to hold them on their lap while you drive.</p>
