#### Indigo Velveteen Cake Ingredients:

Makes 2 small cakes (or 12 cupcakes)

- ½ c coconut milk (canned or packaged)
- 1 T apple cider vinegar
- 10 oz blueberries (around 1 cup when blended)
- 2 t vanilla extract
- 1 c sugar
- ⅓ c sunflower oil (or sub any veggie oil)
- 1 ¼ c flour
- 5 T cocoa powder
- ½ T baking soda
- ½ t baking powder

#### Indigo Velveteen Cake Directions:

**Preheat** the oven to 350°.

**Mix** the coconut milk and vinegar and let sit.

**Blend** the blueberries with the oil on high.

**Add** the blended blueberries and oil to the coconut milk mixture and mix well. Let sit.

**Whisk** the dry ingredients together (flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and 5 T of cocoa powder in a medium sized bowl.

**Sift** the flour mixture into the wet ingredients and mix until there's no visible powder. It should be a dark violet-indigo color.

**Fill** the lightly oiled mini cake pans just over halfway until all the batter is used up. It should fill 5 mini 4" cakes or 12 cupcakes. I use the mini springform pans by Wilton. Place the pans on a baking sheet to make them easier to remove from the oven.

**Bake&nbsp;** at 350º for 34 minutes (or 20 minutes for cupcakes).



#### Lemon Cream Cheese Icing Ingredients:

- 1 8oz package vegan cream cheese (or you can use homemade)
- ¼ c&nbsp;package silken tofu (blended)
- ¼ c organic earth balance
- 2 t vanilla
- 2-3 cups powdered sugar (to taste)
- juice and zest from half of a lemon
- soymilk powder (optional for consistency)
- a few fresh blueberries for garnish



#### Lemon Cream Cheese Icing Directions:

**Beat** the margarine, cream cheese, blended silken tofu, lemon, and vanilla extract together.

**Sift** in the powdered sugar, a cup at a time.

**Build** the cake, gluing together the layers with icing.

Here's another variation my stepmom made using blackberry puree instead of lemon in the icing, and making them in baby bundt cake pans.
