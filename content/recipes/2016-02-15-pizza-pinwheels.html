<h4>Pizza Dough ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 tablespoons yeast</li>
<li>2 cups warm water (I use around 110 degree water)</li>
<li>2 teaspoons raw sugar</li>
<li>5 cups flour</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
<li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>2-4 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
<li>extra flour for dusting rolling surface</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pizza Dough directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Mix</strong> the yeast, water, and sugar in large bowl. Add 3 cups of the flour. Mix well to blend. (I use my kitchenaid for this because kneading dough is my nemesis.)</p>
<p><strong>Add</strong> the oil, salt, garlic, nutritional yeast, and remaining flour and stir well.</p>
<p><strong>Place</strong> the dough to a flour covered board. Dust your hands with flour. Knead for 5 minutes, adding flour if it gets too sticky. (Or, do this with your kitchenaid.)</p>
<p><strong>Roll</strong> dough into a ball and place into a lightly oiled bowl. Cover bowl with towel and set in a warm place for 45 minutes to rise.</p>
<h4>Pizza Pinwheels ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>olive oil</li>
<li>pizza sauce (I usually mix one 15 oz can of organic tomato sauce with one 6 oz can of organic tomato paste, and then I add basil, oregano, and garlic)</li>
<li>1 package grated nondairy cheese (I use follow your heart mozarella)</li>
<li>Any other pizza ingredients you like, cut into very small pieces</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pizza Pinwheels directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Preheat</strong> the oven to 350°.</p>
<p><strong>Line</strong> 2 cookies sheets with parchment paper or sprinkle cornmeal onto a baking stone.</p>
<p><strong>Divide</strong> the dough into 2 equal sized pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Roll</strong> out one section of dough into a rectangle, flouring your surface and your rolling pin before starting.</p>
<p><strong>Brush</strong> the surface with olive oil.</p>
<p><strong>Spread</strong> a thin layer of pizza sauce on your dough.</p>
<p><strong>Add</strong> the toppings one-by-one, but don&#39;t overload it, and make sure you chop your toppings into small pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Roll</strong> slowly and gently, starting with the long end and working your way from one end to the other and back again.</p>

<p><strong>Repeat</strong> the above instructions for the second roll, and when you place it in the fridge to chill, remove roll #1.</p>
<p><strong>Place</strong> the first roll onto a cutting board and cut into one-inch slices.</p>
<p><strong>Place</strong> the pinwheels onto a baking sheet, leaving space in between each one for room to grow.</p>

<p><strong>Sprinkle</strong> the tops with seasonings (optional).</p>
<p><strong>Bake</strong> for 20-25 minutes or until they start to brown.</p>
<p><strong>Serve</strong> with the remaining pizza sauce to dip into.</p>
