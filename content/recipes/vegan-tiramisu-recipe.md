This recipe makes&nbsp;24 coffee cupcakes w/ chocolate mouse filling and cream cheese icing. For pictures of each step, read the accompanying [blog entry](/blog/josipas-birthday-2013).

#### **Cupcake Ingredients:**

- 2 ½ c unbleached white flour
- 3 T cornstarch
- 1 T ener-g egg replacer
- 1 ½ t baking powder
- 1 t baking soda
- 1 t salt
- 1 ½ c sugar
- ⅔&nbsp;c sunflower oil
- 1 ¾&nbsp;c brewed coffee
- ¼ c french vanilla coconut creamer
- 1 T vanilla extract
- 1 T apple cider vinegar

#### **Mousse Ingredients:**

- 1 package silken tofu
- 2 T maple syrup
- ¼ c almond milk or soymilk
- 1 t vanilla extract
- 1 bag (12 oz) chocolate chips

#### **Icing Ingredients:**

- ½ c earth balance
- 1 package (8 oz) tofutti cream cheese
- 2 t vanilla extract
- 4 c powdered sugar (sifted)
- 1 T cocoa powder (garnish)

####   

#### **Cupcake Directions:** 

**Preheat** the oven to 350º.&nbsp; Set up 24 silicone wrappers on 2 baking sheets.

**Combine** wet ingredients and sugar and mix with electric mixer. In another bowl, ix together the dry ingredients.

**Sift** dry ingredients into the wet mixture and mix with electric mixer until there are no lumps remaining.

**Fill** the baking cups about 2/3 full.

**Bake** for 21 minutes, until when you insert a toothpick into the center of one, it comes out clean.

####   

#### **Mousse Directions:**

Using a blender, puree the first four filling ingredients until completely smooth. You may have to scrape the sides of the blender with a spatula a few times. In a double boiler (or setting a metal bowl inside a pot of water), melt an entire bag of chocolate chips over boiling water. Stir the chocolate while it’s melting and when there are no more unmelted chips, remove form heat and add to blender. Blend further, scraping sides as before, until well-combined. Transfer to tupperware and chill.

####   

#### **Icing Directions:**

Using an electric mixer, whip up the first three icing ingredients, sifting in powdered sugar slowly (I add half a cup at a time). Pipe onto the top of cupcakes. Use a sifter to evenly sprinkle the cocoa powder on top of the icing.
