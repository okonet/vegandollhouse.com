<h4>Vegan Chocolate Salad Cake ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 ½ cups whole wheat pastry flour</li>
<li>1 ½ cups unbleached white flour</li>
<li>½ cup cocoa powder</li>
<li>½ tablespoon baking soda</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>½ teaspoon nutmeg</li>
<li>3 tablespoons ground flax mixed with ½ cup warm filtered water (an immersion blender does a really good job of getting this very egglike in consistency)</li>
<li>¾ cup sunflower oil</li>
<li>½ cup canned coconut milk (⅓ of the can)</li>
<li>2 cups sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 cups grated zucchini (the food processor grates really quickly)</li>
<li>2 cups grated carrots (the food processor grates really quickly)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Vegan Chocolate Salad Cake directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Preheat</strong> the oven to 350°.</p>
<p><strong>Coat</strong> the cake pans with any vegetable oil and then dust with cocoa powder.</p>
<p><strong>Combine </strong>vinegar and soymilk and let sit.</p>
<p><strong>Sift</strong> together the flour, cocoa, nutmeg, soda, powder, and salt in their own bowl.</p>
<p><strong>Mix</strong> together oil, sugar, flax goo, and vanilla ina different bowl. Stir until combined.</p>
<p><strong>Sift</strong> dry ingredients into the wet and mix until smooth.</p>
<p><strong>Add</strong> the grated veggies and mix until incorporated.</p>
<p><strong>Fill</strong> the baking pans about <span>½</span> full.</p>
<p><strong>Bake</strong> for 22 minutes for cupcakes, and 32 minutes for 4&#34; springform cakes (or if you&#39;re using a different size, just bake until when you insert a toothpick into the center of one, it comes out clean). This recipe will make one tray of cupcakes and four 4&#34; cakes.</p>

<p>Do you ever have this problem where your cakes come out rounded on top instead of flat?</p>

<p>How are you supposed to stack them? I took a knife and cut the tops off mine. And it reminded me of that episode of Seinfeld where they only sold the muffin tops...Top of the Muffin to Ya!</p>

<p>This is what it looks like topless (not that kind of topless, you perv!)</p>

<h4>Vegan Chocolate Ganache ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 12-oz bags chocolate chips</li>
<li>1 cup canned coconut milk (the other ⅔ of the can)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Vegan Chocolate Ganache directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Heat</strong> the chocolate chips and coconut milk in a saucepan over low heat, stirring often until all chips are almost all the way melted. </p>
<p><strong>Remove</strong> from heat and keep stirring until the ganache is smooth and there are no more lumps.</p>
<p><strong>Cool</strong> the ganache until it&#39;s firm enough to spread between each cake layer.</p>

<p>When you do this, I advise using cake pans that are the same size. I used 3 that were the same and one that was slightly larger, and in the end my cake didn&#39;t stand up nice and straight as I had hoped.</p>
<p><img src="/images/salad-cake6.jpg" alt="2 layers of vegan chocolate salad cake"/></p>
<p>I probably also could&#39;ve waited until the ganache thickened a bit more, but I&#39;m sort of...what do you call it? Oh yeah, impatient.</p>
<p><img src="/images/salad-cake7.jpg" alt="4 layers of vegan chocolate salad cake"/></p>
<p>Due to this impatience, you don&#39;t get to see a picture of the cake full covered in ganache. Sorrryyyyy. I&#39;m the worst food blogger everrrrr.</p>
