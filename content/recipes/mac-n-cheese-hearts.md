Have you been looking for ways to use leftover mac-n-cheese? Or are you thinking, who in their right mind would have leftover mac-n-cheese? Is this website run by robots? I can see your point. However, I have a trick where I make salad and veggie burgers the same night I make mac-n-cheese. Then, assuming you don't live with an [omnomnomnivore](http://threadlessrules.com/post/51527606213/omnomnomnivore-design-by-aled-and-abigail-lewis), you'll typically end up with leftovers.

#### Vegan Mac-n-Cheese Hearts Ingredients:

- ⅓ c flour
- 2 T cornstarch
- 1 t salt
- ½ t pepper
- ¾ c water
- ½ c mashed potato flakes
- 1 t salt
- 2 c leftover vegan mac-n-cheese
- 1 - 1 ½ c safflower, sunflower, or coconut oil



#### Vegan Mac-n-Cheese Hearts Directions:

**Remove** the leftover mac-n-cheese from the fridge, and process in food processor until finely crumbled.

**Press** the mac-n-cheese crumbles into a cookie cutter shape of choice (I used hearts). Alternatively, you can form them into balls with your hands.

**Place** shapes onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and freeze for 1-2 hours, depending on how cold your freezer gets. (Mine look a little funky because I used rainbow bowtie pasta instead of elbow macaroni.)

**Pour** the safflower, sunflower, or coconut oil into a small pot and turn heat to medium.

**Line** a plate with many layers of paper towels or one paper towel on top of a rag.

**Whisk** together ⅓ c flour, 2 T cornstarch, 1 t salt, ½ t pepper, and ¾ c water in a bowl.

**Combine** ½ c mashed potato flakes and 1 t salt in another bowl.

**Remove** the hearts from the freezer.

**Dip** a heart into the wet mixture until completely coated and then dip inot the dry mixture until completely coated.

**Fry** heart in oil until lightly brown, flipping halfway through.

**Remove** heart from oil using a fork, and place onto the paper towel.

**Repeat** with remaining hearts, only adding 3-4 into the pot at once so that the hearts can be in the pot without touching eachother.
