#### Cake ingredients:

- 1 6-oz container vanilla wholesoy yogurt
- 2 cups soy milk
- 1 cup coconut or sunflower oil
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar (or substitute white vinegar)
- 2 cups organic evaporated cane juice (sugar)
- 3 ¼ cups unbleached flour
- ¼ cup organic or non-GMO cornstarch
- ½&nbsp;tablespoon&nbsp;baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon nutmeg
- 1 cup unsalted pistachio pieces (plus some whole pistachios for optional garnishing)
- 4 tablespoons rose powder

#### Cake directions:

**Preheat** the oven to 350°.

**Coat&nbsp;** 2 cake pans with any vegetable, coconut, or sunflower/safflower oil.

**Combine** the yogurt, soymilk, sugar, apple cider vinegar, and oil in one bowl, whisking or stirring with an electric mixer.

**Sift** the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg ingredients together in another bowl. Mix.

**Add** the dry ingredients slowly to the wet mixing in between.

**Grind** &nbsp;the pistachios in a food processor (or chop with a knife).

**Transfer** 2&nbsp;½ cups of the batter to a different bowl. Add the pistachios to this bowl and mix.

**Pour** the batter with the pistachios in it into one of the cake pans.

**Add** the rose powder to the remaining batter. Mix. (I also added a drop of red food coloring because I didn't think the rose powder made it pink enough.)

**Bake** &nbsp;the pistachio cake for 18 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Bake the rose cake for 23 minutes&nbsp;or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.

#### Ganache ingredients:

- 2 bags chocolate chips

#### Ganache directions:

**Melt** &nbsp;the chocolate chips and nondairy milk in a saucepan over low heat, stirring often.

**Once** the chocolate is completely smooth, remove from heat.

**Cool** the chocolate until it becomes thick enough to spread with a knife.

**Remove** one cake layer from baking pan, and place onto a plate.
