I was trying to avoid packing because while I'm quite excited about moving to a new, bigger and better dollhouse, I'm much less excited about all the work required from me over the next 10 days. Soooo...instead of working like a good girl, I decided to make artichoke pâté (like a bad girl?)

#### Artichoke Pâté Ingredients:

- 1 c cooked and rinsed navy or great white northern beans
- ½ c artichoke hearts or artichoke tapenade
- ½ c parsley leaves, destemmed (not a packed half cup, just loosely measured)
- ½ to 1 t salt (depending on how obsessed you are with salt)
- ¼ t pepper
- 1 small clove garlic, minced (or some garlic powder if you don't have any)
- 1 ½ T water (just to get it to blend smoothly)

#### Artichoke Pâté Directions:

**Blend** the ingredients, stopping the blender occasionally to scrape the sides with a silicone spatula. Once it's smooth, you're done.

**Serve** &nbsp;with bread, crackers, pretzels, or veggies.
