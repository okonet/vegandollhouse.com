<h4>Vegan Coconut Cupcake ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 c flour</li>
<li>1 t baking soda</li>
<li>1 t baking powder</li>
<li>½ t salt</li>
<li>2 c shredded coconut</li>
<li>⅔ c coconut oil</li>

</ul>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>Vegan Coconut Cupcake directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Preheat</strong> the oven to 350° and melt the coconut oil in the oven while it&#39;s preheating.</p>
<p><strong>Line</strong> 2 muffin pans with ~18 paper liners.</p>
<p><strong>Combine </strong>vinegar and soymilk and let sit. In another bowl, sift the flour, soda, powder, and salt.</p>
<p><strong>Add</strong> oil, sugar, lemon zest, and vanilla to the soymilk mixture and stir well. Sift dry ingredients into the wet and mix until smooth.</p>
<p><strong>Add</strong> the coconut and mix until incorporated.</p>
<p><strong>Fill</strong> the baking cups about <span>⅔</span> full.</p>
<p><strong>Bake</strong> for 24 minutes, until when you insert a toothpick into the center of one, it comes out clean.</p>

<h4>Vegan Coconut Icing ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ cup earth balance or homemade vegan butter</li>
<li>½ cup organic palm shortening</li>
<li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>3 cups organic powdered sugar</li>
<li>2 cups organic shredded coconut, blended until fine</li>
<li>1 package of speculoos cookies (I get mine from Trader Joe&#39;s)</li>
</ul>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>Vegan Coconut Icing directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Whisk</strong> the earth balance, palm shortening, and vanilla using a handheld mixer or stand mixer with the whisk attachment.</p>
<p><strong>Sift</strong> in powdered sugar, a cup at a time, adding a tablespoon of non-dairy milk periodically if needed.</p>
<p><strong>Add</strong> blended coconut and mix well.</p>
<p><strong>Spoon</strong> onto cooled cupcakes. I used an ice cream scoop to help make them round.</p>

<h4>Vegan Pink Icing and Chocolate Eyes ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ cup cacao butter, melted on low on stovetop</li>
<li>½ cup coconut oil, melted on low on stovetop</li>
<li>½ to 1 cup powdered sugar</li>
<li>red food coloring (I used color garden)</li>
<li><span>½</span> package of vegan chocolate chips</li>
</ul>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>Vegan Pink Icing and Chocolate Eyes directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Melt</strong> a half bag of vegan chocolate chips in a double boiler or in a small pot on low heat.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer</strong> melted chocolate to a squeeze bottle or piping bag fitted with a small round tip (or you can always use a baggie with the cornet cut off to make a hole).</p>
<p><strong>Draw</strong> eyes onto parchment paper laid over a cutting board or plate.</p>
<p><strong>Clear</strong> out a shelf in your fridge and one in your freezer.</p>
<p><strong>Place</strong> eyes in your freezer to harden.</p>
<p><strong>Whisk</strong> the icing ingredients together over medium heat until it&#39;s completely melted and reaches the desired consistency and color.</p>
<p><strong>Remove</strong> from heat, dip the cookies into the icing and poke them into the cupcakes.</p>
<p><strong>Place </strong> the cupcakes into the fridge for the icing to harden.</p>
<p><strong>Remove </strong> the cupcakes from the fridge to spoon or brush the icing to make My Melody&#39;s hood.</p>
<p><strong>Place </strong> the cupcakes into the fridge for the icing to harden.</p>
<p><strong>Remove </strong> the cupcakes from the fridge to carefully apply the eyes. (I had to remove the eyes one-by-one from the freezer to do this, since they&#39;re so thin, they start to melt the second they make contact with your warm fingers.)</p>
<p><strong>Return </strong> the cupcakes to the fridge until they&#39;re ready to be served.</p>
