#### Waffle ingredients:

- 1 c unbleached flour
- ¼ c coconut flour
- 2 T coconut sugar
- ½ c coconut flakes
- 1 ½ T baking powder
- ⅓ c coconut oil (or sub 1 T coconut oil plus coconut oil spray)
- 1 t vanilla extract (if using vanilla soymilk, this is optional)
- 1 ¾ c soymilk (or sub any nondairy milk)
- ¼ c mini chocolate chips (I use Enjoy Life)

#### Waffle directions:

**Melt** the coconut oil in the oven or on the stove if it's in a solid state.

**Whisk** the dry ingredients together (including the sugar), sifting the baking powder if it's lumpy.

**Preheat** the waffle iron.

**Add** the soymilk and vanilla to the dry ingredients, and whisk together.

**Add** &nbsp;half of the chocolate chips to the batter and whisk.

**Add** &nbsp;a tablespoon of the melted coconut oil to the batter and whisk.

**Coat** &nbsp;both sides of the waffle iron with melted coconut oil using a silicone brush (or use coconut oil spray).

**Pour** &nbsp;batter into waffle iron and top batter with extra chocolate chips. Cook waffles as you normally would.
