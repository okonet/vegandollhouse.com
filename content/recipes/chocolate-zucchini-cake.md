#### Vegan Chocolate Salad Cake ingredients:

- 1 ½ cups whole wheat pastry flour
- 1 ½ cups unbleached white flour
- ½ cup cocoa powder
- ½ tablespoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon nutmeg
- 3 tablespoons ground flax mixed with ½ cup warm filtered water (an immersion blender does a really good job of getting this very egglike in consistency)
- ¾ cup sunflower oil
- ½ cup canned coconut milk (⅓ of the can)
- 2 cups sugar
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups grated zucchini (the food processor grates really quickly)
- 2 cups grated carrots (the food processor grates really quickly)



#### Vegan Chocolate Salad Cake directions:

**Preheat** the oven to 350°.

**Coat** the cake pans with any vegetable oil and then dust with cocoa powder.

**Combine** vinegar and soymilk and let sit.

**Sift** together the flour, cocoa, nutmeg, soda, powder, and salt in their own bowl.

**Mix** together oil, sugar, flax goo, and vanilla ina different bowl. Stir until combined.

**Sift** dry ingredients into the wet and mix until smooth.

**Add** the grated veggies and mix until incorporated.

**Fill** the baking pans about ½&nbsp;full.

**Bake** for 22 minutes for cupcakes, and 32 minutes for 4" springform cakes (or if you're using a different size, just bake until when you insert a toothpick into the center of one, it comes out clean). This recipe will make one tray of cupcakes and four 4" cakes.

Do you ever have this problem where your cakes come out rounded on top instead of flat?

How are you supposed to stack them? I took a knife and cut the tops off mine. And it reminded me of that episode of Seinfeld where they only sold the muffin tops...Top of the Muffin to Ya!

This is what it looks like topless (not that kind of topless, you perv!)

#### Vegan Chocolate Ganache ingredients:

- 2 12-oz bags chocolate chips
- 1 cup canned coconut milk (the other ⅔ of the can)

#### Vegan Chocolate Ganache directions:

**Heat** &nbsp;the chocolate chips and coconut milk in a saucepan over low heat, stirring often until all chips are almost all the way melted.

**Remove** from heat and keep stirring until the ganache is smooth and there are no more lumps.

**Cool** the ganache until it's firm enough to spread between each cake layer.

When you do this, I advise using cake pans that are the same size. I used 3 that were the same and one that was slightly larger, and in the end my cake didn't stand up nice and straight as I had hoped.

I probably also could've waited until the ganache thickened a bit more, but I'm sort of...what do you call it? Oh yeah, impatient.

Due to this impatience, you don't get to see a picture of the cake full covered in ganache. Sorrryyyyy. I'm the worst food blogger everrrrr.
