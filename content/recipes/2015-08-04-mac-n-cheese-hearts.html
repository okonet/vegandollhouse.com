<p>Have you been looking for ways to use leftover mac-n-cheese? Or are you thinking, who in their right mind would have leftover mac-n-cheese? Is this website run by robots? I can see your point. However, I have a trick where I make salad and veggie burgers the same night I make mac-n-cheese. Then, assuming you don&#39;t live with an <a href="http://threadlessrules.com/post/51527606213/omnomnomnivore-design-by-aled-and-abigail-lewis">omnomnomnivore</a>, you&#39;ll typically end up with leftovers. </p>
<h4>Vegan Mac-n-Cheese Hearts ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>⅓ c flour</li>
<li>2 T cornstarch</li>
<li>1 t salt</li>
<li>½ t pepper</li>
<li>¾ c water</li>
<li>½ c mashed potato flakes</li>
<li>1 t salt</li>
<li>2 c leftover vegan mac-n-cheese</li>
<li>1 - 1 ½ c safflower, sunflower, or coconut oil</li>
</ul>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>Vegan Mac-n-Cheese Hearts directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Remove</strong> the leftover mac-n-cheese from the fridge, and process in food processor until finely crumbled.</p>
<p><strong>Press</strong> the mac-n-cheese crumbles into a cookie cutter shape of choice (I used hearts). Alternatively, you can form them into balls with your hands.</p>
<p><strong>Place</strong> shapes onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and freeze for 1-2 hours, depending on how cold your freezer gets. (Mine look a little funky because I used rainbow bowtie pasta instead of elbow macaroni.)</p>

<p><strong>Pour</strong> the safflower, sunflower, or coconut oil into a small pot and turn heat to medium.</p>
<p><strong>Line</strong> a plate with many layers of paper towels or one paper towel on top of a rag.</p>
<p><strong>Whisk </strong>together ⅓ c flour, 2 T cornstarch, 1 t salt, ½ t pepper, and ¾ c water in a bowl.</p>
<p><strong>Combine</strong> ½ c mashed potato flakes and 1 t salt in another bowl.</p>
<p><strong>Remove</strong> the hearts from the freezer.</p>
<p><strong>Dip</strong> a heart into the wet mixture until completely coated and then dip inot the dry mixture until completely coated.</p>

<p><strong>Fry</strong> heart in oil until lightly brown, flipping halfway through.</p>

<p><strong>Remove</strong> heart from oil using a fork, and place onto the paper towel.</p>
<p><strong>Repeat</strong> with remaining hearts, only adding 3-4 into the pot at once so that the hearts can be in the pot without touching eachother.</p>
