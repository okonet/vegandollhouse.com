#### Vegan Mocha Cupcake ingredients:

- ½ cup cold coffee
- ½ cup soymilk
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar (you can substitute white vinegar)
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup coconut sugar (you can substitute any vegan sugar)
- ⅓ cup safflower oil (you can substitute with sunflower or coconut oil)
- 1 ½ cups unbleached organic flour (you can substitute other flours, but keep in mind that some of the gluten-free flours absorb more liquid, so you may need to adjust the measurements to get the correct batter consistency)
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ⅓ cup cocoa powder

#### Vegan Mocha Cupcake directions:

**Preheat** the oven to 350°.

**Line** a muffin pan with paper liners.

**Combine** vinegar and soymilk and let sit. In another bowl, sift the flour, cocoa, soda, powder, and salt.

**Add** oil, coffee, sugar, and vanilla to the soymilk mixture and stir well. Sift dry ingredients into the wet and mix until smooth.

**Fill** the baking cups about ⅔&nbsp;full.

**Bake** for 18-20 minutes, until when you insert a toothpick into the center of one, it comes out clean. This recipe should make 12 regular-sized cupcakes.



#### Vegan Coffee Cream Filling ingredients:

- 1 can coconut cream&nbsp;(I buy mine from Trader Joe's, but unfortunately, it's not organic), left in the fridge overnight
- ½ cup organic powdered sugar
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- ¼ teaspoon xantham gum
- 1 packet via instant coffee



#### Vegan Coffee Cream Filling directions:

**Whisk** the ingredients until smooth in the kitchenaid. You want it to form peaks that do not fall.

**Transfer** &nbsp;into a piping bag fitted with the Ateco Decorating Tip #231. (You can substitute any tip if you don't have this one, but keep in mind that the bigger the tip, the bigger hole it will leave in your cupcakes.)

**Poke** each cupcake about halfway through.

**Squeeze** in as much cream filling as you can without it starting to ooze out the top.



#### Vegan Mocha Icing ingredients:

- ¼ cup earth balance or homemade vegan butter
- ¼ cup organic palm shortening
- ½ tablespoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup cocoa powder
- 2 ½ cups organic powdered sugar
- 1 packet via or other instant coffee
- 3 tablespoons hot water



#### Vegan Mocha Icing directions:

**Mix** the instant coffee with 3 tablespoons of hot water until it's dissolved and place into the freezer to cool for at least 20 minutes.

**Mix** the butter, shortening, and vanilla extract with a kitchen aid or handheld mixer until it's smooth and creamy.

**Sift** the powdered sugar and cocoa powder into a separate bowl.

**Add** the powdered sugar mixture slowly, mixing in between each addition.

**Add** a tablespoon of coffee from the freezer everytime the mixture gets too thick. I didn't end up using all 3 tablespoons, but I think that might be because I used a little less powdered sugar than I should've. Just use your eye--you know what icing consistency should look like.

**Pipe** onto cooled cupcakes or cake. This recipe makes enough to pipe onto 12 cupcakes or if you're spreading it with a knife, you can ice 24 cupcakes or a cake.
