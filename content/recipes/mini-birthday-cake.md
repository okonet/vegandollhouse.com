#### Vegan Chocolate Cake ingredients:

- 1 ¼ cups unbleached white flour
- ⅓ cup cocoa powder
- ¾ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- 1 cup soymilk (or substitute other nondairy milk)
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar (or substitute white vinegar)
- ⅓ cup sunflower oil
- ¾ cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract



#### Vegan Chocolate Cake directions:

**Preheat** the oven to 350°.

**Lightly** oil 3 mini springform pans (wilton sells them in packs of 3).

**Combine** vinegar and soymilk and let sit. In another bowl, sift the flour, cocoa, soda, and powder.

**Add** oil, sugar, and vanilla to the soymilk mixture and stir well. Add dry ingredients to wet and mix until smooth.

**Fill** the cake pans about ⅔&nbsp;full.

**Bake** for 22-25 minutes, until when you insert a toothpick into the center of one, it comes out clean. This recipe made enough for 3 small springform pans and a mini heart cake, so have an extra oiled pan ready for your leftover batter.



#### Vegan Vanilla Frosting ingredients:

- ⅓&nbsp;cup earth balance or homemade vegan butter
- ⅓&nbsp;cup organic palm shortening
- 1 ½&nbsp;teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 cups organic powdered sugar
- 1 ½&nbsp;tablespoon nondairy milk
- Food coloring (optional)



#### Vegan Vanilla Frosting directions:

**Whisk** the butter, palm shortening, and vanilla using a handheld mixer or stand mixer with the whisk attachment.

**Sift** in powdered sugar, bit by bit, adding tiny splashes of nondairy milk when it gets too thick.

**Divide** into 3-4 bowls, and add different amount of food coloring to each bowl so you have a few different shades of the same color.

**Build** &nbsp;the cake, gluing the layers together with enough frosting to help them hold together firmly.

**Frost** the entire cake with a thin layer of frosting using an offset spatula (or just a butter knife if you don't have one).

**Pipe** roses onto sides of cake starting at the bottom in a circle around the perimeter of the cake using the lightest color frosting. When you run out the lightest color, fill your piping bag with the middle color and repeat. Use the darkest color for the roses on the top of the cake.
