#### Cupcake Ingredients:

- 2&nbsp;cups fava chickpea flour
- 1 cup cocoa powder
- ¼&nbsp;cup tapioca flour
- ¼ cup potato starch
- ¼ cup arrowroot
- 1&nbsp;½ tablespoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon xanthum gum
- 1&nbsp;½ teaspoons salt
- 1 cup coconut oil (you can sub any flower or vegetable oil if you don't have this)
- 1&nbsp;cup agave
- 1 cup applesauce
- ⅓ cup caramel sauce
- 2 tablespoons vanilla extract
- ½&nbsp;tablespoon almond extract (you can sub more vanilla if you don't have this)
- 1 cup hot water

#### Cupcake Directions:

**Preheat** the oven to 325°.

**Whisk** &nbsp;together the dry ingredients.

**Combine** &nbsp;the wet ingredients using an electric mixer. Measure the hot water last because it helps get the remaining agave and caramel sauce out of the measuring cup.

**Sift** the dry ingredients slowly into the wet while mixing.

**Pour** into 2 lined cupcake pans. Fill them high; they don't rise as much as cupcakes with gluten.
