          <p>I was trying to avoid packing because while I&#39;m quite excited about moving to a new, bigger and better dollhouse, I&#39;m much less excited about all the work required from me over the next 10 days. Soooo...instead of working like a good girl, I decided to make artichoke pâté (like a bad girl?)</p>
<h4>Artichoke Pâté ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 c cooked and rinsed navy or great white northern beans</li>
<li><span>½ c artichoke hearts or artichoke tapenade</span></li>
<li><span><span>½ c parsley leaves, destemmed (not a packed half cup, just loosely measured)</span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>½ to 1 t salt (depending on how obsessed you are with salt)</span></span></span></li>
<li>¼ t pepper</li>
<li>1 small clove garlic, minced (or some garlic powder if you don&#39;t have any)</li>
<li>1 ½ T water (just to get it to blend smoothly)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Artichoke Pâté directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Blend</strong> the ingredients, stopping the blender occasionally to scrape the sides with a silicone spatula. Once it&#39;s smooth, you&#39;re done.</p>
<p><strong>Serve</strong><span> with bread, crackers, pretzels, or veggies.</span></p>
