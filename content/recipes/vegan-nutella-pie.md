#### Pie Ingredients:

- 1 package firm silken tofu (wrapped in a towel for a few minutes)
- ¼ c agave (you can substitute maple syrup)
- ¼ c coconut sugar (you can substitute evaporated cane juice)
- ⅓ c almond milk (I used chocolate almond milk, but you can use any non-dairy milk.)
- ⅔ c&nbsp;[Justin's chocolate hazelnut butter](http://justins.com/item/chocolate-hazelnut-butter/) (There are other companies that make vegan nutella, but this one is my favorite.)
- 1 c chocolate (I buy the semi-sweet chocolate chips at Trader Joe's because they're cheap, but you can use any kind of vegan chocolate.)
- 1 homemade or store-bought graham cracker crust (or you can skip the crust altogether)

#### Pie Directions:

**Blend** the tofu, hazelnut butter, almond milk, agave, and coconut sugar until it's smooth and creamy.

**Melt** &nbsp;the chocolate in a saucepan on low heat, stirring occasionally.

**Add** &nbsp;the melted chocolate to the blender, scrape the sides, and blend again until it's smooth and creamy.

**Pour** &nbsp;the blended ingredients into the pie crust.

**Chill** &nbsp;the pie in the freezer for 30-60 minutes or in the fridge for 2-3 hours.

#### Whipped Cream Ingredients:

- 1 can chilled organic coconut milk (I buy Whole Foods 365 brand.)
- ¼ c organic powdered sugar (Trader Joe's sells this during the holidays, so I usually stock up.)
- 2 t vanilla extract

#### Whipped Cream Directions:

**Whisk** the powdered sugar, coconut milk, and vanilla.

**Pour** &nbsp;the mixture into a whipped cream canister. Add nitrous cartridge. Chill for 30-60 minutes.
