♫&nbsp;Listening to: We by Felix Da Housecat ♫

Disclaimer: I normally wouldn't have posted these since they didn't come out perfect, but I'm participating in [VeganMofo](http://www.veganmofo.com/) this month, and I \*have\* to post something every day. So, even thought the cream filling came out perfectly, I think the twinkie recipe could use improving.



#### Vegan Twinkie ingredients:

- 1¼&nbsp;cups organic unbleached flour
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ tablespoons organic cornstarch
- ½ tablespoon baking powder
- ½&nbsp;teaspoon baking soda
- 1 cup soymilk (or substitute other nondairy milk)
- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar (or substitute white vinegar)
- ⅓ cup safflower oil
- ¾ cups sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

#### Vegan Twinkie directions:

**Preheat** the oven to 350°.

**Coat** the inside cubbies of a canoe pan using a paper towel with safflower oil on it.

**Combine** &nbsp;vinegar and soymilk, stir, and let sit.

**Sift&nbsp;** the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in another bowl and whisk together.

**Add** &nbsp;oil, sugar, and vanilla to the soymilk mixture and stir well. Add dry ingredients into the wet and mix until smooth.

**Fill** &nbsp;the canoe cubbies about half&nbsp;full. I used ¼ cup of batter in each, and&nbsp;I think it was too much. It made my twinkies look like they were wearing a dorky hat. So, don't overfill yours accidentally! This is what too full looks like.

**Bake** for 19 minutes in the center rack (or until a toothpick inserted into the middle of one comes out clean).

This is what overfilled twinkies look like when they come out of the oven—stupid hats on all of them. Grrrrr.

#### Vegan Twinkie Cream Filling ingredients:

- 1 can coconut cream&nbsp;(I buy mine from Trader Joe's, but unfortunately, it's not organic), left in the fridge overnight
- ½ cup organic powdered sugar
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- ¼ teaspoon xantham gum



#### Vegan Twinkie Cream Filling directions:

**Whisk** the ingredients until smooth in the kitchenaid. You want it to form peaks that do not fall.

**Transfer** &nbsp;into a piping bag fitted with the Ateco Decorating Tip #231. (You can substitute any tip if you don't have this one, but keep in mind that the bigger the tip, the bigger hole it will leave at the bottom of your twinkie.)

**Flip** the twinkies onto their backs and poke them in their tummies about halfway through.

**Do** this in 3 or 4 places so you make sure the twinkies don't have any part without cream filling.
