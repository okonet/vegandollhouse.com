#### Red Velvet Cookie Ingredients:

- 2 cups organic unbleached or whole wheat pastry flour
- ⅓ cup cocoa powder
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch or arrowroot powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon baking powder
- 1 tablespoon beetroot powder
- ½ cup organic earth balance
- ½ cup spectrum palm shortening
- 1 cup organic sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon almond extract
- ¼ cup nondairy milk



#### Red Velvet Cookie Directions:

**Mix** the dry ingredients together in a bowl: flour, cornstarch, salt, baking powder, and beetroot powder.

**Mix** the earth balance, shortening, and sugar together on a fast speed using an electric or stand mixer for like 5 minutes. Turn to low.

**Add** the nondairy milk and extracts while mixing.

**Sift** in half of the dry ingredients and mix until incorporated. Sift and mix in the rest.

**Divide** the dough in half and wrap each half in plastic wrap to chill for 3-4 hours.

**Preheat** the oven to 350°.

**Line** two baking sheets with parchment paper, and remove one dough ball from fridge.

**Place** &nbsp;the dough between 2 pieces of parchment paper to roll it out.

**Roll** as thinly as possible. Remove the top piece of parchment and cut out as many shapes as you can, dipping your cookie cutter into flour when needed to keep it from sticking.

**Trade** the dough remnants with the ball that's in the fridge. Keep cutting until the cookie sheets are full of cut outs.

**Bake** for 8-10 minutes.

**Cool** on trays for 10 minutes. Transfer cookies to cooling rack.

If you're feeling ambitious, you can spread cream cheese icing on one and stick another cookie on top to make a cookie sandwich.
