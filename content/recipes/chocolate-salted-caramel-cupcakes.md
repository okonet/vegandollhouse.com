#### Vegan Chocolate Cupcake Ingredients:

- 2 ½ cups unbleached white flour
- ⅔ cup cocoa powder
- ½ tablespoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 cups soymilk (or substitute other nondairy milk)
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar (or substitute white vinegar)
- ⅔ cup sunflower oil
- 1 ¾ cups sugar
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract



#### Vegan Chocolate Cupcake Directions:

**Preheat** the oven to 350°.

**Line** 2 muffin pans with paper liners.

**Combine** vinegar and soymilk and let sit. In another bowl, sift the flour, cocoa, cinnamon, soda, powder, and salt.

**Add** oil, sugar, and vanilla to the soymilk mixture and stir well. Sift dry ingredients into the wet and mix until smooth.

**Fill** the baking cups about ⅔&nbsp;full.

**Bake** for 18-20 minutes, until when you insert a toothpick into the center of one, it comes out clean. This recipe made enough for a tray of minis, a tray of regular-sized, and a mini heart cake.



#### Vegan Vanilla Caramel Icing Ingredients:

- ¾ cup earth balance or homemade vegan butter
- ¾ cup organic palm shortening
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 4 cups organic powdered sugar
- ½ cup caramel sauce (see below for recipe)



#### Vegan Vanilla Caramel Icing Directions:

**Whisk** the butter, palm shortening, and vanilla using a handheld mixer or stand mixer with the whisk attachment.

**Add** the salted caramel and keep mixing until combined.

**Sift** in powdered sugar, a cup at a time.

**Pipe** onto cooled cupcakes.

#### Salted Caramel Ingredients:

- ½ cup earth balance or coconut oil
- ½ cup canned coconut milk (⅓ of the can)
- 2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cup raw sugar
- 1 tablespoon sea salt



#### Salted Caramel Directions:

**Prepare** yourself for a serious upper-body workout. As a person who never exercises, my arms feel like they're going to fall off after I make this. Also, if you're not down with kitchen exercise or the possibility of failure, I recommend purchasing already-made caramel cause because making my own only has a 50% success rate. Hey Boo makes a vegan caramel sauce that's really good.

**Whisk** &nbsp;the ingredients together over medium heat until it reaches the desired consistency and color.

**Cool** for 10 to 15 minutes and then pour into a glass jar to cool to room temperature. You can store this caramel sauce in the fridge for a couple of weeks, but it will solidify. To reheat, just place your glass jar into a saucepan of water on low-medium heat until it becomes a drizzly consistency again.
