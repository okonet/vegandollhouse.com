#### Red Velveteen Cake ingredients:

Makes 5 small cakes (or 12 cupcakes)

- 1 c soymilk
- 1 T apple cider vinegar
- 1 ¼ c flour
- ⅓ c cocoa powder
- ½ baking soda
- ½ baking powder
- ¼ t salt
- ½ c pureed cooked beets (around 2-3 beets)
- 2 t vanilla extract
- 1 c sugar
- ⅓ c sunflower oil (or sub any veggie oil)



#### Red Velveteen Cake directions:

**Preheat** the oven to 350°.

**Mix** the soymilk and vinegar and let sit.

**Whisk** the dry ingredients together (flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, salt) in a medium sized bowl.

**Peel** the cooked beets and cut of the stems before blending. Use the pulse button on the blender and stop it and shake the blender a couple of times in between to make sure it's completely blended. When you measure the half cup of puree for the recipe, make sure you save a few tablespoons of puree for the icing if you want pink icing.

**Add** the wet ingredients (sugar, vanilla, oil, and beet puree) to the soymilk mixture and mix well.

**Sift** the dry ingrients into the wet ingredients and mix until there's no visible powder.

**Fill** the lightly oiled mini cake pans just over halfway until all the batter is used up. It should fill 5 mini 4" cakes or 12 cupcakes. I use the mini springform pans by Wilton. Place the pans on a baking sheet to make them easier to remove from the oven.

**Bake** at 350º for 33 minutes (or 20 minutes for cupcakes).

#### Cream Cheese Icing ingredients:

- 1 package vegan cream cheese (I used kite hill)
- ¼ c organic earth balance
- 1 t vanilla
- 2-3 cups powdered sugar
- a squeeze of lemon juice
- 2-3 T beet puree for color



#### Cream Cheese Icing directions:

**Beat** the margarine, cream cheese, and vanilla extract together.

**Sift** in the powdered sugar, a cup at a time.

**Pour** over cooled cakes using an offset spatula to help spread it around.
