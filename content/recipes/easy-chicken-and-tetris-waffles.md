I know that typically the chicken is supposed to be fried, but I thought I would try a healthier spin, and I used Beyond Meat's chicken (which I love!) Just heat the chicken according to the Directions on the package.



#### Waffle Ingredients:

- 2 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon (optional)
- 2 tablespoons baking powder
- 2 tablespoons coconut oil
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- 2 cups [non-dairy milk](http://www.vegan.com/milk/) (either sweetened or unsweetened)



#### Waffle Directions:

**Whisk** the dry ingredients together first, and then add the wet ingredients and stir.

**Coat** the waffle iron with coconut oil in between each waffle. Use a silicone brush to get inside all the nooks and crannies in your waffle iron.

**Follow** the Directions for your waffle iron to make the waffles.

**Cut** the waffle into bite sized pieces based on your favorite tetris shapes.
