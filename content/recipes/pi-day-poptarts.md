Pi day is probably Zen's favorite day of the year. Since we have plans on March 14 this year (and I will be crazy busy preparing for our amazing [bakesale](http://vegandollhouse.com/blog/vegan-bakesale)), we decided to prepare for Pi day in advance.

#### Poptart crust ingredients:

- 2 ½ c unbleached flour
- 8 T earth balance
- 4 T evaporated cane juice (or vegan sugar)
- Cold water

#### Poptart crust directions:

**Combine** the flour, sugar, and earth balance in the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. If you don't have a stand mixer, you can use a food processor.

**Slowly** add cold water in a steady stream while the mixer or food processor is running. Stop adding water when the dough forms a ball.

**Roll** a third of the dough as thin as you can without it breaking, adding flour when needed to keep from sticking to the surface or the rolling pin.

**Cut** shapes out of the dough using a poptart or pie pocket maker.

The poptart maker I have is made by wilton, and I bought it at Target. However, if you don't have one, you can use a cookie cutter or even just a lid to a jar.

#### Poptart filling ingredients:

- 1 ½ cups of frozen cherries
- 1 c sugar
- 1 t almond extract
- 2 T cornstarch

#### Poptart filling directions:

**Combine** cherries, sugar, almond extract, and cornstarch in a pot on medium heat.

**Reduce** heat to low when it starts to bubble.

**Remove** from heat when it has thickened.

When the filling has cooled, you can start assembling the poptarts. Preheat your oven to 350º.

Place one piece of dough onto one side of the poptart maker.

Spoon in a bit of filling, but leave a half an inch around the perimeter so that it won't squeeze out the sides.

Cover with another piece of dough.

Squeeze the poptart together to crimp the edges.

If you're using a cookie cutter, just use your fingers or a fork to crimp the edges.

Transfer to a cookie sheet or baking stone.

Bake at 350º for 20 minutes. Cool completely before icing.

#### Poptart icing ingredients:

- 8 ounces organic powdered sugar
- 1 t vanilla extract
- 1 t almond extract
- 2 T organic corn syrup

#### Poptart icing directions:

**Combine** everything with a mixer.

**Brush** onto cooled poptarts with a silicone brush, back of a spoon, your finger, whatever.

I used colored sugar that I had leftover from when I made [pokeball cupcakes](http://vegandollhouse.com/blog/pokeparty), but there are a variety of vegan sprinkles on the market that you can purchase as well. Some of them can be found in my [gingerbread dollhouse](http://vegandollhouse.com/blog/gingerbread-dollhouses) post.
