♫&nbsp;Listening to: Play by Fickle Friends ♫

I remember the first time I made these was 3 years ago for Lulu's birthday. I had a different blog back then at [ieatcupcakes.com](http://ieatcupcakes.tumblr.com/) where all my pictures were taken with an iPhone so they all looked really bad. Here was my [original post](http://ieatcupcakes.tumblr.com/post/59565093615/vegan-gluten-free-meatloaf-cupcakes). Now I have created my own lentil loaf recipe that I prefer over many others that I've tried. This recipe makes 15 lentil lovelies.

#### Lentil Loaf Ingredients:

- 1 c dry lentils
- ⅓ c millet
- 3 c vegetable broth
- 2 T ground flax seed
- ¼ c warm water
- 1 T extra virgin olive oil
- 1 small yellow onion
- 1-5 cloves of garlic, to taste
- 2 celery stalks
- 1 carrot
- 1 parsnip (or sub another carrot)
- 1 t salt
- 1 t black pepper
- 1 t thyme
- ¼ t rosemary
- ¼ t sage
- ½ c oat flour
- 2 T ground flax seed
- ¼ c mashed potato flakes
- 2 slices of toast
- ¼ c ketchup
- 1 T molasses

#### Lentil Loaf Directions:

**Rinse** the lentils and millet.

**Boil** the broth, lentils, and millet in a medium-sized pot.

**Cover** , reduce heat to low, and simmer until liquid is absorbed (30-60 minutes), stirring occassionally.

**Preheat** the oven to 350°.

**Cut** 15 squares of parchment paper and use a glass or your hand to press the paper into each cubby of a cupcake pan, making sure the parchment paper hangs over the edges by an inch or 2.

**Whisk** the flax egg with 2 T ground flax and ¼ c warm water.

**Process** the toast until it turns into breadcrumbs and set aside.

**Peel** the onion and process it in a food processor (or dice by hand).

**Sauté** the onion in olive oil in a cast iron pan over medium heat.

**Process** the carrot, parsnip, garlic, and celery until they're chopped finely (or dice or grate by hand).

**Add** the carrot, parsnip, garlic, and celery to the pan and sauté for 5 more minutes.

**Add** the spices to the pan, and remove from heat.

**Process** over half of the lentil/millet mixture.

**Mix** the lentils, millet, flax egg, breadcrumbs, flax egg, veggie mixture, oat flour, and additional ground flax seed. Stir well.

**Scoop** the mixture into each cubby of the muffin pan (lined with parchment paper) using an ice cream scoop if you have one.

**Press** &nbsp;the scoops down into the cubbies with the back of the scoop.

**Bake** &nbsp;the little lentil loaves for 15 minutes, and remove them from the oven.

**Mix** the ketchup and molasses together to create a BBQ glaze.

**Spread** &nbsp;the glaze on top of each little lentil loaf.

**Bake** &nbsp;the glazed little lentil loaves for 10 more minutes.



#### Mashed Potatoes Ingredients:

- 2 pounds potatoes
- ¼ c organic earth balance
- ½ - 1 c almond milk (or sub any unsweetened, unflavored nondairy milk)
- 1 t salt
- ½ t pepper

#### Mashed Potatoes Directions:

**Peel** the potatoes, cutting off any bad spots.

**Cut** the potatoes into one-inch cubes, place in a pot, and cover with water.

**Boil** the potatoes on high heat, reduce heat to medium, and boil for 15 minutes.

**Drain** the potatoes in a colander in the sink.

**Transfer** the potatoes back to the pot, add the earth balance, salt, and pepper, and mash with a potato masher.

**Transfer** the potatoes to the bowl of a stand mixer and affix with the whisk attachment.

**Whisk** the potatoes adding nondairy milk slowly until the potatoes are a creamy consistency (pictured below).

These can be made in advance, chilled overnight, and reheated in an oven for 15 minutes until mashed potato tops have browned slightly.
