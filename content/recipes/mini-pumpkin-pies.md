This recipe will make 48 mini pies (using 2 mini muffin pans)

#### Pumpkin Tartlet Crust Ingredients:

- 2 ¼ c flour
- ½ t salt
- 2 T evaporated cane juice (or sub any vegan sugar)
- ½ c solid coconut oil
- ½ c ice water



#### Pumpkin Tartlet Crust Directions:

**Combine** the flour, salt, and sugar in the food processor and pulse to mix.

**Add** the coconut oil and process.

**Drizzle** the ice water in slowly while processing.

**Remove** &nbsp;half of the dough, and roll it on a floured surface as thin as possible without it breaking.

**Cut** &nbsp;the dough into circles, flowers, or whatever shape cutter you have (I used a scalloped circle).

**Coat** the insides of the mini muffin pan cubbies with coconut oil (or any cooking oil).

**Place** &nbsp;the dough circles into the mini muffin pan cubbies, pressing them down into the holes slightly.

**Chill** &nbsp;the muffin pan until you're ready to prebake it.

**Prebake** &nbsp;the crusts for 10 minutes at 350° once the filling is ready.
