          <p>Hot pockets were one of those foods my parents would never buy, which made me want them even more. When I got older, I had a calzone, which I thought was a huge hot pocket, but turned out to be filled with ricotta instead of mozerella...gross! I somehow managed to make this just out of ingredients I bought from Costco (except for the yeast, which I always have at home because it stays good in the fridge for like ever and takes up a teeny tiny amount of room).</p>
<h4> </h4>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Knead</strong> for 5 minutes, adding flour if it gets too sticky. Roll dough into a ball and place into a lightly oiled bowl. Cover bowl with towel and set in a warm place for 45 minutes to an hour. </span></p>
<h4> </h4>

<li>1/2 t garlic powder</li>

<h4> </h4>
<h4>Pizza Sauce directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Mix</strong> everything together in a bowl.</p>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>Toppings:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>sliced mushrooms (I like the baby portabellas from costco to get my vitamin D)</li>
<li>kale (costco has the huge bag of organic baby kale)</li>
<li>spinach (costco has organic)</li>
<li>daiya cheese (costco has this now)</li>
<li>green olives (I know traditionally people use black olives on pizza, but they&#39;re made with lye. Ew.)</li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Knead</strong> dough again. Divide in half and roll half into a thin crust. Cutout shapes with a cookie cutter or knife. </span></p>

<p><span><strong>Top</strong> with sauce and toppings. I have this handy pocket pie maker that I got during valentine&#39;s day a few years ago, but you can just as easily use a fork to press the edges closed.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Place</strong> identical shape on top and press edges with a fork or your fingers.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="/images/pizza-heart-baking-sheet.jpg" alt=""/></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Place</strong> as many as you can fit on a baking stone and bake for 10 minutes at 500º.  Remove from oven and let cool.</span></p>
