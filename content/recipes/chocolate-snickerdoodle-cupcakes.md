#### Vegan Chocolate Snickerdoodle Cupcake ingredients:

- 2 ½ cups unbleached white flour
- ⅔ cup cocoa powder
- ½ tablespoon cinnamon
- ½ tablespoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 cups soymilk (or substitute other nondairy milk)
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar (or substitute white vinegar)
- ⅔ cup sunflower oil
- 1 ¾ cups sugar
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract



#### Vegan Chocolate Snickerdoodle Cupcake directions:

**Preheat** the oven to 350°.

**Line** 2 muffin pans with paper liners.

**Combine** vinegar and soymilk and let sit. In another bowl, sift the flour, cocoa, cinnamon, soda, powder, and salt.

**Add** oil, sugar, and vanilla to the soymilk mixture and stir well. Sift dry ingredients into the wet and mix until smooth.

**Fill** the baking cups about ⅔&nbsp;full.

**Bake** for 18-20 minutes, until when you insert a toothpick into the center of one, it comes out clean. This recipe made enough for a tray of minis, a tray of regular-sized, and a mini heart cake.

#### Vegan Snickerdoodle Icing ingredients:

- ¾ cup earth balance or homemade vegan butter
- ¾ cup organic palm shortening
- 3-4 tablespoons of soymilk (or substitute another nondairy milk)
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 5 cups organic powdered sugar
- ½ teaspoon cinnamon (optional for garnish)
- 2 tablespoons sugar (optional for garnish)



#### Vegan Snickerdoodle Icing directions:

**Whisk** the butter, palm shortening, and vanilla using a handheld mixer or stand mixer.

**Sift** in powdered sugar, a cup at a time, adding soymilk when it gets too thick.

**Pipe** onto cooled cupcakes.

**Mix** cinnamon with sugar. Since I use organic raw sugar, the granules are bigger than white sugar, so I mixed mine using a mortar and pestle.

**Sprinkle** over iced cupcakes using a sifter. &nbsp;Here's a picture of the sprinkling action.
