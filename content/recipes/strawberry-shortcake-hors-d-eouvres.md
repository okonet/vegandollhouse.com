#### Shortcake ingredients:

- 3 c flour
- 1 T baking powder
- ¼&nbsp;t salt
- 5 T&nbsp;cold coconut oil or earth balance
- 5 T sugar
- 1 c non-dairy milk

#### Shortcake directions:

**Preheat** the oven to 400°.

**Using** the dough hook, combine the dry ingredients in the kitchenaid.

**Cut** in the earth balance or coconut oil little pieces at a time and mix until crumbly.

**Slowly** add the non-dairy milk while mixing until all the dough forms a nice tight ball.

**Place** the dough on a lightly floured cutting board or counter and roll it to ½&nbsp;inch thickness.

**Cut** out shapes using a cookie cutter.

**Line** 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper.

**Place** the cut dough pieces gently onto the cookie sheets.

**Bake** for 10-20 minutes, depending on the size of your biscuits. I baked mine for only 10 minutes, because they were babies.

**Remove** from the oven and transfer to cooling racks.

#### Whipped Cream ingredients:

- 2 cans of coconut cream (I buy mine from Trader Joe's, but unfortunately, it's not organic.)
- 2 T vanilla
- ½&nbsp;c powdered sugar
- ½ t xantham gum

#### Whipped Cream directions:

**Whisk** the ingredients until smooth in the kitchenaid.

**Transfer** into piping bag fitted with tip of choice.

**Chill** &nbsp;bag overnight if you're planning to pipe it like I am.



To assemble, I just piped a dollop of whipped cream onto each biscuit. Then I took a cute toothpick, poked a strawberry slice, and then poked the rest of the toothpick into the biscuit topped with whipped cream.

If you have to transport these after you make them (like to the patio of a nearby bar), I suggest bringing a friend to volunteer to hold them on their lap while you drive.
