<p>Makes 24 bears</p>
<h4>Chocolate Crust ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>24 Newman O&#39;s or Joe Joe&#39;s (or I guess Oreos if you must, but do you really want to eat those?)</li>
<li>¼ cup earth balance or coconut oil, melted</li>
</ul>
<h4>Chocolate Crust directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Process</strong> the cookies in the food processor until they are fine crumbs.</p>
<p><strong>Slowly</strong> add the melted oil while the food processor is still spinning.</p>
<p><strong>Line </strong>2 cupcake pans with papers.</p>
<p><strong>Press</strong> the mixture into the bottoms of cupcake papers.</p>
<h4>Pumpkin Cheesecake ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 packages silken tofu, rinsed and patted dry with paper towels or a kitchen towel</li>
<li>1 can pumpkin</li>
<li>2 T cornstarch</li>
<li>8 oz vegan cream cheese</li>
<li>1 <span>½ </span>c sugar</li>
<li>1 T cinnamon</li>
<li>1 t nutmeg</li>
<li>½ t cloves</li>
<li>¼ t ginger</li>
<li><span>¼ t salt</span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Pumpkin Cheesecake directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Preheat</strong> the oven to 325°.</p>
<p><strong>Blend</strong> all the ingredients, stopping once to scrape down the sides with a spatual before blending once more.</p>
<p><strong>Pour</strong> the filling into the cupcake papers, filling them about 3/4 of the way.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth</strong> the tops with the back of a spoon.</p>
<p><strong>Bake</strong> for 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into one comes out clean.</p>
<p><strong>Chill</strong> overnight in the fridge, uncovered.</p>
<p><strong>Decorate</strong> with chocolate chips and chocolate buttons. <a href="http://www.tcho.com/shop/chocolate/baking">TCHO</a> makes vegan dark chocolate buttons, but if you live in London, you can get them from a bunch of places. I used these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dairy-Free-White-Chocolate-Buttons/dp/B007C54WEQ">dairy free white chocolate buttons</a> because that&#39;s what I had lying around the house, but I don&#39;t think you can buy them anywhere in the U.S.</p>
