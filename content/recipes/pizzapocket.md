Hot pockets were one of those foods my parents would never buy, which made me want them even more. When I got older, I had a calzone, which I thought was a huge hot pocket, but turned out to be filled with ricotta instead of mozerella...gross! I somehow managed to make this just out of ingredients I bought from Costco (except for the yeast, which I always have at home because it stays good in the fridge for like ever and takes up a teeny tiny amount of room).



#### Pizza Dough Ingredients:

- 5 c white flour (costco has organic unbleached)
- 2 c warm water
- 2 t sugar (costco has organic)
- 2 T active dry yeast
- 2 t salt
- 1 t garlic powder
- 3 T nutritional yst
- 2 T olive oil (costco has organic)



#### Pizza Dough Directions:

**Mix** the yeast, water, and sugar in large bowl.&nbsp; Add 3 cups of the flour. Mix well to blend. 

**Add** the oil, salt, garlic, nutritional yeast, and remaining flour and stir well.

**Place** the dough to a flour covered board. Dust your hands with flour.

**Knead** for 5 minutes, adding flour if it gets too sticky. Roll dough into a ball and place into a lightly oiled bowl. Cover bowl with towel and set in a warm place for 45 minutes to an hour.



#### Pizza Sauce Ingredients:

- 1 can tomato sauce (costco has organic)
- 1 can tomato paste (costco has organic)
- 1 t basil
- 1 t oregano
- 1/2 t thyme
- 1/2 t garlic powder
- 1/2 t onion powder
- 1/2 t pepper
- 1/2 t salt



#### Pizza Sauce Directions:

**Mix** everything together in a bowl.



#### Toppings:

- sliced mushrooms (I like the baby portabellas from costco to get my vitamin D)
- kale (costco has the huge bag of organic baby kale)
- spinach (costco has organic)
- daiya cheese (costco has this now)
- green olives (I know traditionally people use black olives on pizza, but they're made with lye. Ew.)

**Knead** &nbsp;dough again. Divide in half and roll half into a thin crust. Cutout shapes with a cookie cutter or knife.

**Top** with sauce and toppings. I have this handy pocket pie maker that I got during valentine's day a few years ago, but you can just as easily use a fork to press the edges closed.

**Place** identical shape on top and press edges with a fork or your fingers.

**Place** as many as you can fit on a baking stone and bake for 10 minutes at 500ยบ.&nbsp; Remove from oven and let cool.
