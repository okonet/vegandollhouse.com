          <p>Pi day is probably Zen&#39;s favorite day of the year. Since we have plans on March 14 this year (and I will be crazy busy preparing for our amazing <a href="http://vegandollhouse.com/blog/vegan-bakesale">bakesale</a>), we decided to prepare for Pi day in advance.</p>
<h4>Poptart crust ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 ½ c unbleached flour</li>
<li>8 T earth balance</li>
<li>4 T evaporated cane juice (or vegan sugar)</li>
<li>Cold water</li>
</ul>
<h4>Poptart crust directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Combine</strong> the flour, sugar, and earth balance in the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. If you don&#39;t have a stand mixer, you can use a food processor.</p>
<p><strong>Slowly</strong> add cold water in a steady stream while the mixer or food processor is running. Stop adding water when the dough forms a ball.</p>
<p><strong>Roll</strong> a third of the dough as thin as you can without it breaking, adding flour when needed to keep from sticking to the surface or the rolling pin.</p>
<p><strong>Cut</strong> shapes out of the dough using a poptart or pie pocket maker.</p>
<p>The poptart maker I have is made by wilton, and I bought it at Target. However, if you don&#39;t have one, you can use a cookie cutter or even just a lid to a jar.</p>

<h4>Poptart filling ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 ½ cups of frozen cherries</li>
<li>1 c sugar</li>
<li>1 t almond extract</li>
<li>2 T cornstarch</li>
</ul>
<h4>Poptart filling directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Combine</strong> cherries, sugar, almond extract, and cornstarch in a pot on medium heat.</p>
<p><strong>Reduce</strong> heat to low when it starts to bubble.</p>
<p><strong>Remove</strong> from heat when it has thickened.</p>
<p>When the filling has cooled, you can start assembling the poptarts. Preheat your oven to 350<span>º.</span></p>
<p><span>Place one piece of dough onto one side of the poptart maker.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="/images/poptarts1.jpg" alt=""/></span></p>
<p>Spoon in a bit of filling, but leave a half an inch around the perimeter so that it won&#39;t squeeze out the sides.</p>

<p>Cover with another piece of dough.</p>

<p>Squeeze the poptart together to crimp the edges.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re using a cookie cutter, just use your fingers or a fork to crimp the edges.</p>

<p>Transfer to a cookie sheet or baking stone. </p>

<p>Bake at 350<span>º for 20 minutes. Cool completely before icing.</span></p>
<h4>Poptart icing ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>8 ounces organic powdered sugar</li>
<li>1 t vanilla extract</li>
<li>1 t almond extract</li>
<li>2 T organic corn syrup</li>
</ul>
<h4>Poptart icing directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Combine</strong> everything with a mixer.</p>
<p><strong>Brush</strong> onto cooled poptarts with a silicone brush, back of a spoon, your finger, whatever.</p>
<p>I used colored sugar that I had leftover from when I made <a href="http://vegandollhouse.com/blog/pokeparty">pokeball cupcakes</a>, but there are a variety of vegan sprinkles on the market that you can purchase as well. Some of them can be found in my <a href="http://vegandollhouse.com/blog/gingerbread-dollhouses">gingerbread dollhouse</a> post.</p>
