#### Black Forest Ice Cream Directions:

**Whisk** the arrowroot with ¼ c almond milk. Add 1 T vanilla. Whisk again. Set aside.

**Stir** &nbsp;the sugar, remaining almond milk, and creamer in a saucepan over medium heat.

**Once** &nbsp;the ingredients in the saucepan start to boil, remove from heat and whisk in the arrowroot mixture.

**Chill** &nbsp;in refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight.

**Add** &nbsp;enough cherries to the blender to cover the blades.

**Blend** &nbsp;the cherries until they are frozen dust. Let sit.

**Pour** &nbsp;the chilled ice cream into an ice cream maker. Once the ice cream is almost done, transfer it from the ice cream maker into a bowl. (Hint: If you don't have an ice cream maker, you can also just put this in the freezer, and stir it every half hour, but it takes a lot longer that way. Or you can pick up an inexpensive Donvier, like the one I have for under $15 used.)

**Add** &nbsp;the&nbsp;cherry puree.

**Swirl** &nbsp;the cherry into the ice cream.

**Add** &nbsp;the chocolate chips to the ice cream. If you don't have access to vegan mini ones, you can use normal sized ones. These are Enjoy Life, but I think Ghiradelli makes vegan minis too.

**Serve** &nbsp;the ice cream immediately or spoon into molds or tupperware and freeze.
