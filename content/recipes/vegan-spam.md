#### Ingredients:

- 1/4 c braggs liquid aminos
- 1/4 c olive oil
- 1/4 t liquid smoke or hickory smoke salt
- 1 block extra firm tofu

#### Directions:

**Slice** X-firm tofu as thin as possible without it breaking, and use a small cookie cutter to cut out your shape of choice. I made hearts. You layer them in between layers of paper towels for a few minutes to wick the moisture out of them.

**Make** a delicious spamlike marinade by combining the 1/4 c olive oil, the 1/4 c braggs liquid aminos, and the 1/4 t hickory smoke. Then brush it onto the bottom of a glass pyrex baking pan.

**Lay** each piece of tofu into the pyrex pan as closely together as possible so you can fit them all.

**Brush** the tops of the tofu pieces with the marinade using a pastry or silicone brush. If you don't have a brush, you can just use your hands and a spoon.

**Bake** the tofu in the oven (~350Ëš) for 20 minutes, and then flip them all over. Brush marinade over the other side. Bake for another 20 minutes. Cool.
