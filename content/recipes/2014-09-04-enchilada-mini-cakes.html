          <p><span>♫ Listening to: Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want by The Smiths ♫</span></p>
<p><span>School started yesterday, and I&#39;m already over it! Can that be possible? My biggest qualm with school this year is that the children who could polish off an entire bag of popchips in approximately 85 seconds over the summer break are now <span>all of a sudden &#34;not hungry&#34; when they&#39;re at school. I consider myself to be a pretty hands-off parent, but I basically only have to follow one rule in this parenting game—keep them alive. They&#39;re making it very difficult for me to follow my rule with this 8-hour-long daily fast.</span> Also, I do not ever recall a time in my life (at any age) when I didn&#39;t feel like eating. Can I please have that problem??? I wish I could trade my appetite for theirs. But until I find a <span id="docs-internal-guid-f4d2ca3f-3e37-7eb1-b585-70fed774dad2"><span>sorceress</span></span> to perform that magic, I am racking my brain to try to come up with foods that they will be willing to take time away from socializing to eat. Unless these firm up tonight in the fridge (enough to hold in your hand and eat like a cupcake while walking around chatting), I think this might have been a failed attempt. But they&#39;re still super yummy.</span></p>
<h4>Enchilada Mini Cakes ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 onion, finely diced (I used a food processor)</li>
<li>a few tablespoons of olive oil</li>
<li>one can tomato sauce</li>
<li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>2 teaspoons chili powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 teaspoon bouillon or 1 bouillon cube</li>
<li>1 cup hot water</li>
<li>1 package organic corn tortillas</li>
<li>1 can black beans, rinsed</li>
<li>vegan cheese</li>
</ul>
<h4>Enchilada Mini Cakes directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Preheat</strong> oven to 350°.</p>
<p><strong>Grease</strong> a cupcake pan with olive or other oil.</p>
<p><strong>Sauté</strong> the onion in the olive oil on med-high heat.</p>
<p><img src="/images/enchiladas1.jpg" alt="Sauteeing onion"/></p>
<p><strong>Add</strong> the tomato sauce once the onion is soft and translucent.</p>
<p><strong>Stir</strong> onions and sauce and reduce heat to low.</p>
<p><strong>Add</strong> the spices. I usually measure everything into a small bowl before adding so I don’t get steam in my spice jars.</p>

<p><strong>Stir</strong> everything well and let simmer on low heat.</p>
<p><strong>Dissolve</strong> your bouillon in the hot water (or you can use premade veggie broth if you have it). I use the bouillon paste because it dissolves faster than the rapunzel bouillon cubes. You can get this huge jar at Costco for under $10, and it lasts quite awhile.</p>

<p><strong>Add</strong> broth to pan and stir well.</p>
<p><strong>Cut</strong> each corn tortilla into 4 triangles and place them into the pan of enchilada sauce burying them under the sauce to get warm and soft.</p>

<p><strong>Remove</strong> each triangle from the pan using tongs and place into the cupcake cubbies. You can use as many triangles per cubby as you like, but a minimum of 3 is recommended.</p>

<p><strong>Repeat</strong> this until all tortillas are used up or until your cupcake pan is full. My tortillas were used up before my cupcake cubbies were.</p>
<p><strong>Scoop</strong> 2 teaspoons of rinsed black beans into each cubby.</p>

<p><strong>Top</strong> each enchilada cake with a scoop of cashew cheese or a sprinkle of grated daiya</p>

<p><strong>Spoon</strong> the remaining enchilada sauce on top of each enchilada cake.</p>
<p><img src="/images/enchiladas8.jpg" alt="vegan enchilada mini cakes"/></p>
<p><strong>Bake</strong> for 20 minutes if you plan to reheat some later or 30 minutes if not.</p>
<p><strong>Cool</strong> for 10 minutes before removing from pan.</p>
<p><strong>Serve</strong> immediately or store in freezer or refrigerator.</p>
