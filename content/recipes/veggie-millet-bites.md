#### Veggie Millet Bite ingredients:

- ⅔ c millet
- ⅓ quinoa
- 1 T boullion
- 2 c water
- 2 T coconut oil
- 1 onion
- 2 stalks celery, finely diced
- 2 carrots, finely diced
- 2 c spinach, finely diced
- 2 c kale, finely diced
- 1 t garlic powder
- 1 t salt
- 2 T psyllium husk

#### Veggie Millet Bite directions:

**Preheat** the oven to 375°.

**Cook** the millet, quinoa, boullion, and water the same you would with any grain--bring to a boil, and turn down to low until water is gone.

**Dice** the onion finely (I use the food processor to make sure all the veggies are diced as finely as possible with minimal effort on my part).

**Saute** the onion.

**Add** the celery.

**Add** the carrot.

**Add** the spinach and kale.

**Add** the spices.

**Add** the millet and quinoa to the veggies and mix thoroughly.

**Mix** the psyllium husk with 4 T water.

**Add** the psyllium mixture to the rest and mix evenly.

**Form** into balls or other shapes and place onto baking stone or greased baking sheet (or line with parchment).

**Bake** for 25 minutes.
