          <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 pounds extra firm tofu</li>
<li>1/2 pound spinach, kale, or other greens</li>
<li>1 8-10 oz. package of mushrooms</li>
<li>1 onion, diced</li>
<li>2-3 T olive oil</li>
<li>1 t salt</li>
<li>1/2 t garlic powder</li>
<li>1/4 t pepper</li>
<li>1/2 t cumin</li>
<li>1/4 t curry powder</li>
<li>1/2 t turmeric</li>
<li>1/2 t basil</li>
<li>3 T nutritional yeast</li>
<li>1 T braggs liquid aminos (you can sub soy sauce if needed)</li>
<li>1/4 c water</li>
<li>Phyllo dough</li>
</ul>
<h4>Directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Saute</strong> the onion on medium-high heat in the olive oil. </p>
<p><strong>Drain</strong> the water from the tofu. This can either be easy (if you have a tofu press) or a workout (if you have to place the tofu in a kitchen towel and squeeze all the water out by hand).</p>
<p><strong>Add</strong> the tofu to the onion and stir well. Reduce heat to medium.</p>
<p><strong>Wash</strong> and slice the mushrooms, removing and composting the stems. Add them to the pot. Stir often.</p>
<p><strong>Add</strong> spinach or other chopped greens to the pot. Stir often.</p>
<p><strong>Mix</strong> the spices (salt, pepper, garlic powder, basil, curry powder, cumin, turmeric, nutritional yeast, and braggs liquid aminos) in a jar or cup with 1/4 c water. I usually put it all into a jar, tighten the lid, and shake.</p>
<p><strong>Pour</strong> seasoning sauce over the tofu scramble and stir well. Reduce heat to low.</p>
<p><strong>Cut</strong> 4 inch squares of phyllo dough using sharp kitchen scissors. Be careful during this step. If you haven&#39;t used phyllo before, it&#39;s like trying to work with wet tissue paper...very delicate. You&#39;ll be using 4 squares per basket, so you can calculate how many you&#39;ll need to cut that way.</p>

<p><strong>Brush</strong> olive oil all over each layer of phyllo before stacking them together. </p>

<p><strong>Stack</strong> 4 pieces on top of each other, either aligned as squares or staggered the way I did.</p>

<p><strong>Lay</strong> the 4 layers over a cupcake/muffin tin cubby, and fill with 1/4 c of scramble.</p>

<p><strong>Close</strong> the baskets by folding the edges of the phyllo toward the center, like you&#39;re wrapping a present.</p>

<p><strong>Bake</strong> according to the directions on the packaging for the phyllo dough.</p>
