How much is the doggie donut in the window? (arf! arf!) These doggie donuts are cake donuts with a solid chocolate coating like Little Debbies or Entemann’s donuts. Before I was vegan, I used to go to the Entemann’s outlet store and buy multiple boxes of the chocolate covered donuts at a time. I was an addict, and the list of ingredients was so long, I’m surprised they could fit them all on the side of the box! When I first discovered this donut recipe on VeganYumYum many years ago, I was so excited to finally be able to feed my addiction yet again. My inspiration for these doggie donuts was born when I was in Hawaii and Japan in 2015 and saw so many cute donuts with animal faces. They were all pastel colored and made to look like different animals, and I knew immediately that the world needed a vegan version. This recipe makes 9 donuts.

#### Doggie Donut ingredients:

- 2 cups unbleached flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 cup vanilla soymilk (or substitute any non-dairy milk)
- ½ tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- ½ tablespoon vanilla extract
- egg replacer for 2 eggs (I used ener-g)
- ½ cup vegan butter (or substitute any vegetable oil)

#### Doggie Donut directions:

**Preheat** the oven to 350°.

**Mix** the wet ingredients in a saucepan over low-med heat until the margarine melts and sugar dissolves (the wet ingredients are the last 6 in the list).

**Mix** the dry ingredients together in a bowl (the first 5 in the list).

**Mix** the dry and wet ingredients together just until incorporated.

**Press&nbsp;** the batter into 9 ungreased donut-shaped molds.

**Bake&nbsp;** for 13-15 minutes.

**Remove&nbsp;** from oven and place pans on cooling racks.

**Remove&nbsp;** donuts from the pans using a flexible silicone spatula, by shimmying the spatula down the sides of the down so far that it curls all the way underneath each donut (start this step only when completely cooled).



#### Chocolate Coating ingredients:

- 1 12 oz bag of chocolate chips

#### Chocolate Coating directions:

**Melt** the chocolate chips in a double boiler (or in a saucepan on low).

**Paint** the melted chocolate onto the cooled donuts using a silicone spatula.



#### Decorations ingredients:

- Ears: 5 large dandies marshmallows or 18 minis (You can substitute fondant.)
- Eyes: 18 white chocolate chips (You can substitute any similarly-sized candies or sprinkles.)
- Noses: 9 round pink, red, or white sprinkles (You can substitute any circle-shaped edible decoration)
- Mouths: 18 long pink, red, or white sprinkles (I use Lieber’s, and if I dig around, I can usually find some curved sprinkles that make the doggie look like he’s smiling.)

#### Decorations directions:

**Cut** each marshmallow into 4 slices if you're using large dandies.

**Shape** each marshmallow slice into a dog ear using your hands. Set each one on parchment paper as you finish.

**Choose** your facial features, and separate out 9 sets of them so they’re ready to place.

**Paint** the top of a donut with chocolate using a silicone pastry brush. If you don’t have a silicone brush, dip the top of a donuts into the melted chocolate. Set it on a cooling rack or parchment paper, chocolate side up.

**Place** 2 ears on the donut and press lightly into the melted chocolate.

**Place** the nose, mouth, and eyes, using kicthen tweezers if you have them. Repeat process with each donut.

**Chill** all 9 decorated donuts for 15 minutes (or freeze for 5 minutes) to harden the chocolate.
