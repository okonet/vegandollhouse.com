<p>I remember the first time I made these was 3 years ago for Lulu&#39;s birthday. I had a different blog back then at <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.tumblr.com/">ieatcupcakes.com</a> where all my pictures were taken with an iPhone so they all looked really bad. Here was my <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.tumblr.com/post/59565093615/vegan-gluten-free-meatloaf-cupcakes">original post</a>. Now I have created my own lentil loaf recipe that I prefer over many others that I&#39;ve tried. This recipe makes 15 lentil lovelies.</p>
<h4>Lentil Loaf ingredients:</h4>

<h4>Lentil Loaf directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Rinse</strong> the lentils and millet.</p>
<p><strong>Boil</strong> the broth, lentils, and millet in a medium-sized pot.</p>
<p><strong>Cover</strong>, reduce heat to low, and simmer until liquid is absorbed (30-60 minutes), stirring occassionally.</p>
<p><strong>Preheat</strong> the oven to 350°.</p>
<p><strong>Cut</strong> 15 squares of parchment paper and use a glass or your hand to press the paper into each cubby of a cupcake pan, making sure the parchment paper hangs over the edges by an inch or 2.</p>
<p><strong>Whisk</strong> the flax egg with 2 T ground flax and ¼ c warm water.</p>
<p><strong>Process</strong> the toast until it turns into breadcrumbs and set aside.</p>
<p><strong>Peel</strong> the onion and process it in a food processor (or dice by hand).</p>
<p><strong>Sauté</strong> the onion in olive oil in a cast iron pan over medium heat.</p>
<p><strong>Process</strong> the carrot, parsnip, garlic, and celery until they&#39;re chopped finely (or dice or grate by hand).</p>
<p><strong>Add</strong> the carrot, parsnip, garlic, and celery to the pan and sauté for 5 more minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Add</strong> the spices to the pan, and remove from heat.</p>
<p><strong>Process</strong> over half of the lentil/millet mixture.</p>
<p><strong>Mix</strong> the lentils, millet, flax egg, breadcrumbs, flax egg, veggie mixture, oat flour, and additional ground flax seed. Stir well.</p>
<p><strong>Scoop</strong> the mixture into each cubby of the muffin pan (lined with parchment paper) using an ice cream scoop if you have one.</p>

<p><strong>Press</strong> the scoops down into the cubbies with the back of the scoop.</p>
<p><strong>Bake</strong> the little lentil loaves for 15 minutes, and remove them from the oven.</p>
<p><strong>Mix</strong> the ketchup and molasses together to create a BBQ glaze.</p>
<p><strong>Spread</strong> the glaze on top of each little lentil loaf.</p>

<p><strong>Drain</strong> the potatoes in a colander in the sink.</p>

<p>These can be made in advance, chilled overnight, and reheated in an oven for 15 minutes until mashed potato tops have browned slightly.
