Makes 24 bears

#### Chocolate Crust Ingredients:

- 24 Newman O's or Joe Joe's (or I guess Oreos if you must, but do you really want to eat those?)
- ¼ cup earth balance or coconut oil, melted

#### Chocolate Crust Directions:

**Process** the cookies in the food processor until they are fine crumbs.

**Slowly** add the melted oil while the food processor is still spinning.

**Line** 2 cupcake pans with papers.

**Press** the mixture into the bottoms of cupcake papers.

#### Pumpkin Cheesecake Ingredients:

- 2 packages silken tofu, rinsed and patted dry with paper towels or a kitchen towel
- 1 can pumpkin
- 2 T cornstarch
- 8 oz vegan cream cheese
- 1 ½&nbsp;c sugar
- 1 T cinnamon
- 1 t nutmeg
- ½ t cloves
- ¼ t ginger
- ¼ t salt

#### Pumpkin Cheesecake Directions:

**Preheat** the oven to 325°.

**Blend** &nbsp;all the ingredients, stopping once to scrape down the sides with a spatual before blending once more.

**Pour** the filling into the cupcake papers, filling them about 3/4 of the way.

**Smooth** the tops with the back of a spoon.

**Bake** for 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into one comes out clean.

**Chill** overnight in the fridge, uncovered.

**Decorate** with chocolate chips and chocolate buttons. [TCHO](http://www.tcho.com/shop/chocolate/baking) makes vegan dark chocolate buttons, but if you live in London, you can get them from a bunch of places. I used these [dairy free white chocolate buttons](http://www.amazon.com/Dairy-Free-White-Chocolate-Buttons/dp/B007C54WEQ) because that's what I had lying around the house, but I don't think you can buy them anywhere in the U.S.
