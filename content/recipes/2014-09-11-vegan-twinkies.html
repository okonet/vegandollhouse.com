<p>Disclaimer: I normally wouldn&#39;t have posted these since they didn&#39;t come out perfect, but I&#39;m participating in <a href="http://www.veganmofo.com/">VeganMofo</a> this month, and I *have* to post something every day. So, even thought the cream filling came out perfectly, I think the twinkie recipe could use improving.</p>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>Vegan Twinkie ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1<span>¼</span> cups organic unbleached flour</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 ½ tablespoons organic cornstarch</li>
<li>½ tablespoon baking powder</li>
<li><span>½ </span>teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">1 cup soymilk (or substitute other nondairy milk)</span></li>
<li>1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar (or substitute white vinegar)</li>
<li>⅓ cup safflower oil</li>
<li>¾ cups sugar</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract<span style="color: #222222; font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.25;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Vegan Twinkie directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Preheat</strong> the oven to 350°.</p>
<p><strong>Coat</strong> the inside cubbies of a canoe pan using a paper towel with safflower oil on it.</p>
<p><span><strong>Combine</strong> </span>vinegar and soymilk, stir, and let sit.</p>
<p><strong>Sift </strong>the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, baking powder, and salt i<span>n another bowl and whisk together.</span></p>
<p><strong>Add</strong> oil, sugar, and vanilla to the soymilk mixture and stir well. Add dry ingredients into the wet and mix until smooth.</p>
<p><strong>Fill</strong> the canoe cubbies about half full. I used <span>¼ cup of batter in each, and </span>I think it was too much. It made my twinkies look like they were wearing a dorky hat. So, don&#39;t overfill yours accidentally! This is what too full looks like.</p>

<p><strong>Bake</strong> for 19 minutes in the center rack (or until a toothpick inserted into the middle of one comes out clean).</p>
<p>This is what overfilled twinkies look like when they come out of the oven—stupid hats on all of them. Grrrrr.</p>

<h4>Vegan Twinkie Cream Filling ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 can coconut cream<span> (I buy mine from Trader Joe&#39;s, but unfortunately, it&#39;s not organic)</span>, left in the fridge overnight</li>
<li>½ cup organic powdered sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
<li><span>¼ teaspoon xantham gum</span></li>
</ul>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>Vegan Twinkie Cream Filling directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Whisk</strong> the ingredients until smooth in the kitchenaid. You want it to form peaks that do not fall.</p>

<p><strong>Transfer</strong> into a piping bag fitted with the Ateco Decorating Tip #231. (You can substitute any tip if you don&#39;t have this one, but keep in mind that the bigger the tip, the bigger hole it will leave at the bottom of your twinkie.)</p>

<p><strong>Flip</strong> the twinkies onto their backs and poke them in their tummies about halfway through.</p>

<p><strong>Do</strong> this in 3 or 4 places so you make sure the twinkies don&#39;t have any part without cream filling.</p>
