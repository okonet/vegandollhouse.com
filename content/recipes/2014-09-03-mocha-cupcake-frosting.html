<h4> </h4>
<h4>Vegan Mocha Cupcake ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ cup cold coffee</li>
<li>½ cup soymilk</li>
<li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar (you can substitute white vinegar)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>1 cup coconut sugar (you can substitute any vegan sugar)</li>
<li>⅓ cup safflower oil (you can substitute with sunflower or coconut oil)</li>
<li>1 ½ cups unbleached organic flour (you can substitute other flours, but keep in mind that some of the gluten-free flours absorb more liquid, so you may need to adjust the measurements to get the correct batter consistency)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>⅓ cup cocoa powder</li>
</ul>
<h4>Vegan Mocha Cupcake directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Preheat</strong> the oven to 350°.</p>
<p><strong>Line</strong> a muffin pan with paper liners.</p>
<p><strong>Combine </strong>vinegar and soymilk and let sit. In another bowl, sift the flour, cocoa, soda, powder, and salt.</p>
<p><strong>Add</strong> oil, coffee, sugar, and vanilla to the soymilk mixture and stir well. Sift dry ingredients into the wet and mix until smooth.</p>
<p><strong>Fill</strong> the baking cups about <span>⅔</span> full.</p>
<p><strong>Bake</strong> for 18-20 minutes, until when you insert a toothpick into the center of one, it comes out clean. This recipe should make 12 regular-sized cupcakes.</p>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>Vegan Coffee Cream Filling ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 can coconut cream (I buy mine from Trader Joe&#39;s, but unfortunately, it&#39;s not organic), left in the fridge overnight</li>
<li>½ cup organic powdered sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
<li><span>¼ teaspoon xantham gum</span></li>
<li>1 packet via instant coffee</li>
</ul>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>Vegan Coffee Cream Filling directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Whisk</strong> the ingredients until smooth in the kitchenaid. You want it to form peaks that do not fall.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer</strong> into a piping bag fitted with the Ateco Decorating Tip #231. (You can substitute any tip if you don&#39;t have this one, but keep in mind that the bigger the tip, the bigger hole it will leave in your cupcakes.)</p>

<p><strong>Poke</strong> each cupcake about halfway through.</p>
<p><strong>Squeeze</strong> in as much cream filling as you can without it starting to ooze out the top.</p>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>Vegan Mocha Icing ingredients:</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>¼ cup earth balance or homemade vegan butter</li>
<li>¼ cup organic palm shortening</li>
<li>½ tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>½ cup cocoa powder</li>
<li>2 ½ cups organic powdered sugar</li>
<li>1 packet via or other instant coffee</li>
<li>3 tablespoons hot water</li>
</ul>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>Vegan Mocha Icing directions:</h4>
<p><strong>Mix </strong> the instant coffee with 3 tablespoons of hot water until it&#39;s dissolved and place into the freezer to cool for at least 20 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Mix</strong> the butter, shortening, and vanilla extract with a kitchen aid or handheld mixer until it&#39;s smooth and creamy.</p>
<p><strong>Sift</strong> the powdered sugar and cocoa powder into a separate bowl.</p>
<p><strong>Add </strong> the powdered sugar mixture slowly, mixing in between each addition.</p>
<p><strong>Add </strong> a tablespoon of coffee from the freezer everytime the mixture gets too thick. I didn&#39;t end up using all 3 tablespoons, but I think that might be because I used a little less powdered sugar than I should&#39;ve. Just use your eye--you know what icing consistency should look like.</p>
<p><strong>Pipe </strong> onto cooled cupcakes or cake. This recipe makes enough to pipe onto 12 cupcakes or if you&#39;re spreading it with a knife, you can ice 24 cupcakes or a cake.</p>
