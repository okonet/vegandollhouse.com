          <p>I got super excited recently to see that one of the food bloggers (<a href="http://instagram.com/tpat35">Tish P.</a>) I follow on instagram made her own butter from scratch! I didn&#39;t even realize that was something people did. I thought you either bought earth balance or you didn&#39;t use butter. Those were the 2 options in my mind. I&#39;m so naive.</p>
<p>So, upon a quick google search, I realized that many people are making their own vegan butter. Why am I always the last person to hear about these things?! I followed <a href="http://www.veganbaking.net/recipes/fats/vegan-butters/vegan-butter">this recipe</a> exactly, but I think I&#39;ll make a few changes in the future. I used a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar, because I don&#39;t have (nor have I ever heard of) coconut vinegar. And I used the liquid soy lecithin, because I prefer the taste (or lack of taste I should say) over the dry. </p>
<p>The recipe suggested using Tovolo ice cube molds, but who wants square shaped butter? Squares, that&#39;s who. I used some star-shaped silicone molds. You can use anything really. You can even just use your leftover earth balance tub from when you run out.</p>
