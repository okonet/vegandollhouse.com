Sometimes you want to make a dinner that shows someone you love them, but you don't love them enough have the time/energy to make an elaborate meal. Instead of the obvious option of using dry erase markers to write XOXO all over the rim of their plate, you can instead make XOs out of food.

This is a super easy peasy meal of asparagus sauteed in olive oil and sprinkled lightly with sea salt. You can substitute green beans if you don't care for asparagus.

The rice is just steamed brown rice with diced baby portabella mushrooms that were tossed in after about 20 minutes. The sauce is a simple teryaki sauce that my mommy taught me how to make that has only 4 ingredients: olive oil, tamari sauce, garlic, and ginger root.
