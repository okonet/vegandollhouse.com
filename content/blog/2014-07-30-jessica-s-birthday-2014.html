          <p>If you know Jessica, then you know she&#39;s the most adorable person that ever lived. So, when she asked for strawberry shortcake as her birthday dessert, I immediately started brainstorming how I could make it as cute as her. Okay, that&#39;s not possible, but I at least had to try. Strawberry shortcake has this <span id="docs-internal-guid-ac8056e6-8568-6e1d-dce3-692391c8d9bf"><span>connotation</span></span>, for me at least, as being this hard biscuit with shapeless pieces of strawberries strewn about, and a glob of whipped cream. It&#39;s not an attractive dessert. The colors are nice, but that almost always happens when you&#39;re willing to sacrifice taste (ahem, chocolate) for looks (brown is just not a cute color, pretty much ever).</p>
<p>So, after a lot of brainstorming, I finally narrowed it down to 3 possibilities. Keep in mind, this dessert will be served at a bar, so it can&#39;t be a big <span id="docs-internal-guid-ac8056e6-8573-dbe9-92d5-966af68d1a65"><span>beautiful</span></span> layered cake with perfect triangle slices on cute colored plates with bamboo utensils. This isn&#39;t that kind of birthday party. It has to be a low-maintenance, easy-to-sneak-into-somewhere-if-needed, easy-to-consume type of dessert.</p>
<p>So, the 3 finalists: 1) layered in small mason jars, 2) A swirl roll, but I&#39;ll have to put it on a lollipop stick or skewer to keep it from being too messy to eat, or 3) Bite sized strawberry shortcake hors d&#39;oeuvres. Okay, while I know Jessica likes the swirl and would very much appreciate it, I don&#39;t think I want my first time experimenting with something difficult to be on her birthday. So, now I have it narrowed down to 2. Since I don&#39;t yet have a dishwasher(!!!), I think I&#39;ll choose #3!</p>
<p>The plan is to make biscuits (that aren&#39;t too hard) and to use the cute scalloped cookie cutters that I borrowed from Jessica to cut out cute bite-sized biscuits. Then I&#39;ll cut each strawberry into heart shapes. Then I have to attempt to make a whipped cream that will hold up outside of the fridge for a number of hours (this is the real challenge!).</p>
<p> I think I nailed it.</p>
<p>The scalloped heart biscuit...</p>

<p>The whipped cream that held up to piping, and even stayed throughout the night.</p>

<p>The heart shaped strawberry slices held together with heart toothpicks.</p>

<p>So, that was part 1 of the Jessica birthday weekend. Part 2 consisted of a tea party at the Crown &amp; Crumpet pop-up shop in New People Mall. I&#39;ve only ever been to the big Crown &amp; Crumpet for Jessica&#39;s half birthday one year, so this was a bit different, but it did not disappoint! Our server, or as they call them &#34;Trolly Dolly&#34; was a super cute punk rock girl with colored hair and an adorable voice. Even though, I brought my own creamer (they offer soymilk, but I am really partial to the coconut creamer by so delicious) and my own daiya cheese for the tri-colores sandwich (It&#39;s vegan if you just have them make it without the <span id="docs-internal-guid-ac8056e6-8574-e73a-48a8-f6de30305fdf"><span>mozzarella</span></span>, but I&#39;m a piggie and I wanted the cheese on it), our Trolley Dolly still said I was the best vegan she&#39;s ever had!!! That is the first time anyone has ever said that to me. I can die now.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a picture of my plate. The house salad is vegan by default.</p>

<p>And what would a trip to Japantown be without an obligatory trip to Pika Pika?</p>
