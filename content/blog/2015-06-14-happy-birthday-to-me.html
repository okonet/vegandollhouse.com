          <p>2015 was a big birthday for me, so I wanted to make sure I did something different so I would remember it forever. The answer was obvious. Ride a unicorn. And nobody wants to ride a unicorn alone, so I coerced some friends to ride unicorns with me.</p>
<p>Here we are walking from Pam&#39;s house to the Zeum Museum.</p>

<p>We thought my dress might be floofy enough to hide everyone behind it, so of course, the theory had to be tested.</p>

<p>Is this the unicorn I get to ride?<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> </span></p>

<p>I thought I would have to drag them kicking and screaming into this adventure, but there was no kicking, and only some minor yelping (which may have come from me), but I still got to drag them.</p>

<p>Unicorns aren&#39;t really meant to have people riding on them, so we gave them a little break while Jessica perfected her heart-hands.</p>

<p>Mia and her unicorn decided to sing a duet.</p>

<p>Aren&#39;t Jocelyn and her unicorn so photogenic?</p>

<p>Awwww...Pamela ended up making friends with her unicorn.</p>

<p>Mia&#39;s unicorn must have given her superpowers so she was able to ride with no hands and not fall off!</p>

<p>Just so you don&#39;t think I&#39;m a speciesist, the carousel had horses too.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://accordingtomelj.com/">Mel</a> for taking pictures of us on the carousel!</p>

<p>As if riding unicorns wasn&#39;t enough to make the best birthday ever, but when we got back to Pam&#39;s house, I realized that they surprised me with THE CUTEST tea party in the entire world.</p>
