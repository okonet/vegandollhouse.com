          <p><a href="http://rockmyvegansocks.vaskor.ca/">Kimmy</a> and I are organizing a bakesale to raise money for <a href="http://www.dpsrescue.org/">Doggie Protection Services (DPS)</a>. They helped Kimmy find her souldog (aka doggie soulmate obvs) Sunny, and Isabelle has been making friends with all kinds of doggies by volunteering at their adoption events. I was even lucky enough to foster a boxer named Fireball for DPS for one night, and I haven&#39;t stopped thinking about him since.</p>
<p>If you love doggies (or if you hate doggies, but you love eating vegan desserts), come out to the bakesale and say hi, and get some treats for yourself or a friend.</p>
<p>If you like to bake, <a href="mailto:vegandollhouse@gmail.com">email me</a> if you are interested in donating some cupcakes or donuts or cookies or poptarts or whoopie pies or...is it just me or does writing blog posts make you hungry?</p>
<p>We will have donations from Pepple&#39;s donuts, Cinnaholic, Imagine It Bakery, Feel Good Desserts, Alternative Baking Company, Earth Balance, Miglets, Raw Daddy Foods, and many local vegan home bakers. Everything will be vegan, and there will be gluten-free options as well.</p>
<p>The bakesale will be held from 2-5pm on Satuday, March 15 at Pet Food Express in San Jose. The address is 5148 Stevens Creek Blvd., San Jose, CA.</p>
