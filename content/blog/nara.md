Oh. My. Gawsh. First Bunny Island and now a city that has wild deer walking around??? Can this country be any cuter?

Nara Park is where the deer hang out. It's not like they walk down the street and window shop like the rest of the tourists. I think they like the park because there's a guy selling crackers to humans for the humans to feed the deer. It's probably not the best thing for the deer to eat, but I bought 2 anyway. I know, I know. Worst Vegan Ever.

When I saw this sign, I started feeling like I didn't choose the right outfit for this adventure. The deerying (that's the word for when a deer bullies you) that I experienced wasn't even listed on the sign, so I guess they didn't consider it a danger. There was one deer in particular who kept trying to eat the bows off of my dress.

When you run out of deer crackers, they just look at you like they want more. It's sooooo sad. How could I not buy more?!

I did a periscope while I was there, and Ashley suggested that I should try to get hugs from the deer. Thanks Ashley!!!

This one is sticking his tongue out at me. I'm not sure whyyyy....I'm sure it has nothing to do with him being annoyed that I refused to purchase a third bundle of crackers.

Another cute thing about Nara is that everything in the town seems to be deer themed, from the stairs in the train station to the potholes in the roads.

When we were walking down the street, I learned that I've been kneading dough the wrong way my whole life. Here's a [short video](https://youtu.be/BW0Zd7QEgW4) of the way they do it in Japan.

For lunch, we found a vegan restaurant called Kinatei.

The meals were bento style and came with tea or coffee, but they didn't have any soymilk sadly.
