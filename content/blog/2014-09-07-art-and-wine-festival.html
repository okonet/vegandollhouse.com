          <p>After attending a couple of vegan beer fests and jpop summit recently, I told myself to start avoiding activities where there are large amounts of people. This epiphany was based on a couple of factors, one being the fact that I don&#39;t really care for other humans, and the other being that I don&#39;t have the patience to wait in long lines before getting what I want.</p>
<p>So, when I found out there was an art &amp; wine festival a few blocks from my house, I was a bit hesitant to attend. However, the thought of walking around carrying my polka dotted wine glass helped me get over any doubts I may have had. Since I wasn&#39;t sure what vegan wine options there would be, we started our walk with a glass of wine from home called Barrel 27 High on the Hog from 2010.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn&#39;t as crowded as the events that had scared me away from attending such festivals. There was far more art than wine for sure, and the only vineyard I actually talked with was Bonterra, where I discovered that their white wines are vegan, but not their reds. Another benefit of their winery is that they&#39;re not only organic, but biodynamic. I think I might visit their winery next time I&#39;m in Mendocino. In case you&#39;re ever unsure whether a wine is vegan, and you don&#39;t have the opportunity to talk with the winery in person, the <a href="http://www.barnivore.com/wine">barnivore website</a> is a good resource (they also have a phone app called vegaholic).</p>
<p>Some of the art we saw that we liked included a woodworking booth where we bought the cutest cutting board and serving tray (it&#39;s reversible!) I have ever seen with 6 or 7 different types of wood in it. It&#39;s made by a small shop called <a href="http://davidlevycreations.com/">Hardwood Creations</a> that&#39;s located near Sacramento.</p>

<p>There was also a vendor there that made the most adorable dresses, but they&#39;re only in kiddo sizes. Why do kids get all the cute clothes?! So, I of course had to come straight home and make a similar (but enormous) dress to fit me.</p>

<p>Since I have no boobs, I made the back and front the exact same size and shape, so I can choose each day which way I want to wear it. Maybe I was secretly trying to follow the reversible theme that my new cutting board had spawned.</p>

<p>Another enticing thing I saw at the festival was a little girl eating a delicious looking ice cream cone. I don&#39;t think downtown Mountain View serves vegan ice cream cones anywhere, so I decided to make my own at home.</p>
<p> I started with a box of plain cones.</p>

<p>Next, I melted about a third of a bag of chocolate chips.</p>
<p><img src="/images/artwine2.jpg" alt="melting vegan chocolate chips"/></p>
<p>While the chocolate was melting, I gathered up some sprinkles and such. I know it can be difficult to find vegan sprinkles, trust me, I&#39;m constantly on the lookout. Here are a couple of brands that I know of that are vegan, but if you have other suggestions, please comment below. One thing I&#39;ve been looking for forever that I can&#39;t seem to find is vegan star-shaped sprinkles. I have them on my tattoo, but have never had them in real life. If you know where to get them, I might propose marriage.</p>

<p>Once the chocolate is melted, dip the cone into it.</p>

<p>Next, before the chocolate dries, dip the cones into vegan sprinkles (or shredded coconut or cookie crumbs or mini chocolate chips or anything really).</p>

<p>Then let them air dry. Or if you&#39;re impatient like me and have been craving an ice cream cone since you saw a little girl eating one hours before, then stick them in the freezer for 10-15 minutes.</p>

<p>Once the chocolate has hardened, top with ice cream. I&#39;ve been on this kick for the past couple of months where I only want to eat the chocolate salted caramel ice cream from Steve&#39;s, because basically all other ice cream tastes subpar after having that kind.</p>

<p> So, yeah, that&#39;s how the art &amp; wine festival basically wrote the agenda for my entire day.</p>
