          <p>Can you think of the happiest you&#39;ve ever been in your life? Maybe there are a lot of different experiences that come to mind. Mine was a couple of weeks ago on Bunny Island. My life is basically downhill from here, haha.</p>
<p>I should probably start by admitting that I don&#39;t really go outside. I&#39;m not outdoorsy. I don&#39;t spend my weekend mornings hiking. I don&#39;t camp. It&#39;s just not really my thing. So, it is possible that part of the euphoric experience of Okunoshima for me was just being in nature.</p>
<p>The island of Okunoshima itself is gorgeous! Unlike the islands near San Francisco, it wasn&#39;t rocky and super steep. It was relatively flat which made for easy bunny access and a remarkable view of the sunset from the island.</p>

<p>Even just the traveling to the island on the train was beautiful. I loved everything about my visit, and I&#39;m counting the days until I can go back! Next time I&#39;ll stay longer than only one night. I brought a lot of snack to eat on the long train ride including these heart-shaped chips that we picked up in Harajuku.</p>

<p>After taking a whole bunch of train rides, you arrive at a port where you wait for the ferry. In case you&#39;re unsure of where to wait, there&#39;s a helpful sign.</p>

<p>The ferry ride to the island makes you feel like you&#39;re in a scene from Jurassic Park.</p>

<p>The hotel was a traditional Japanese hotel, so at 6pm or so, they come around to your room and lay out your sleeping pads on the japanese mat floors. There&#39;s a toilet and a sink in your room, but the showers are in the public onsen, so if you go, I hope you don&#39;t have an issue with being next to naked people...while you&#39;re naked...and if you&#39;re me, you might have to watch other people shower so that you can learn what to do because you&#39;ve never been in an onsen before. And that&#39;s not awkward at all!</p>
<p>Don&#39;t worry, I waited until I was alone before taking these picturesÂ <span>of the onsen</span>. Just because I stare at people while they shower doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t know where the line is drawn and when not to cross it (except for those times when I just touch my toe across the line, but that doesn&#39;t count, right?)</p>

<p>The hotel comes with an all-you-can-eat buffet for dinner and breakfast. I just assumed there would be nothing I could eat, so I packed a lot of snacks for the trip. However, to my surprise, the staff were really helpful (and the other tourists too!), so I was able to find quite a lot of vegan food to eat there! I still recommend bringing snacks though, because the hotel doesn&#39;t provide lunch, and the trip to and from the island is a long journey in itself. Here&#39;s a picture of some of the food that was vegan on the breakfast buffet.</p>
<p><img src="/images/bunnyislandbuffet.jpg" alt="okunoshima island hotel vegan food"/></p>
<p>There was also cold tofu, seaweed salad, and other things that I didn&#39;t care for.</p>
<p>In addition to bringing snacks for you, you may want to bring snacks for the bunnies. This is a decision each vegan must make for his/herself. The island doesn&#39;t sell food for the purpose of not wanting the bunnies to become reliant on being fed. There are plenty of plants on the island that they can eat, so I think the ideal situation is to let them eat what they are meant to eat. However, I was gifted a bag of grass pellets from a japanese girl, and I fed the bunnies every last pellet. It made them come to me and sit on my lap, and made me the happiest I&#39;ve ever been in life, so when I go back, I will be feeding them. I hope that doesn&#39;t make me a bad vegan.</p>
<p>I created a youtube channel specifically for videos of Bunny Island, so if you&#39;d like to see bunnies hopping around in their natural habitat, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwkKvKR-QXtX3y-fGohNiUw">check them out</a>. Oh, and youtube won&#39;t let me change my URL for my channel until I have 100 followers, so please subscribe to my channel while you&#39;re there.</p>
<p>And if you don&#39;t like videos of bunnies (that&#39;s obviously impossible), here are some pictures of the bunnies.</p>

<p>There are more remote areas of the island where you can go that have fewer bunnies, but the ones you do find seem to be a little different.</p>
<p><img src="/images/bunnyisland5.jpg" alt="bunny island"/></p>
<p>They chill more, and they don&#39;t run up to you when they see you.</p>

<p>I caught this one giving herself a little bath.</p>

<p>So, there&#39;s one downside to bunny island. The bunnies are hunted by crows, so some of them have wounds on their ears and faces from the crow attacks. I had the chance to save a baby bunny from being taken by a crow, but then it made me sad to think about what will happen now that I&#39;m not there to save all the bunnies. This one on the left has a missing eye and chunks taken out of his ears.</p>

<p>If you look in the sky of this picture, you can see the crow flying. When the crows make a noise, the bunnies all run into the woods to hide.</p>

<p>Some naughty bunny figured out where the food was coming from and decided to cut out the middleman (me).</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever wondered if bunnies do yoga, here&#39;s your answer.</p>
