          <p>Pokemon seems to be a phase that everyone goes through at some point in their life (except for me because I think it may have been born when I was into punk rock music and thought I was too tough to like cute little kid stuff). Zen and Isabelle went through a pokemon stage a few years ago, and like most stages it faded away, and the Phamphey and Piplup jackets I made them went unworn. Then all of a sudden, after I had basically forgotten what the word pokemon meant, they came back to life--like little cute supernatural zombie creatures! Now all I hear about is charmander and houdour and celebi. So, it wasn&#39;t a huge surprise when I asked what kind of cupcakes Isabelle and Ashleigh wanted for their 12th birthday dance party, and they said the theme was pokemon.</p>
<p>Since they didn&#39;t mind what flavor the cupcakes were, I made chocolate cupcakes with vanilla-almond icing.</p>

<p>Isabelle had this black decorating icing leftover from her super cute <a href="http://vegandollhouse.com/blog/halloween2013">Halloween Jack Skellington cupcakes</a> that happens to be vegan by default (but not good for you, so use it sparingly).</p>

<p><span>The first step of making pokeballs is to make a premier ball. </span>If you have any pokemon fans in your life, you may have been told what a premier ball is. If your attention span all of a sudden reduces from 1 hour to 2.3 seconds when someone starts talking about pokemon like mine does, then you probably don&#39;t remember what the difference between a regular pokeball and a premier ball is. I left one of the pokeballs as a premier ball because one of Isabelle and Ashleigh&#39;s friends doesn&#39;t eat red food coloring, so she got a special premier ball at the party.</p>

<p>You can buy red sugar from the store. I didn&#39;t. I like my organic raw, unbleached sugar, so I made my own red sugar.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t have a mortar and pestle, you can just use a spoon and a bowl.</p>

<p>I applied the red sugar to the pokeballs by spooning on spoonfuls while tilting the cupcakes over the bowl.</p>
