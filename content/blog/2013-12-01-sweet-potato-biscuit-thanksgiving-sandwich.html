          <p>I used to hate Thansgiving. I thought it was a day that celebrated an upsetting time in history by slaughtering millions of turkeys. However, I have now come to see that Thanksgiving is actually a day to celebrate 4 days off of work, quality time with family and friends (which apparently is now called friendsgiving, although I just discovered this yesterday so the PIC [people in charge] must have forgotten to send me the email informing me of the change), and a bountiful harvest. The only harvest I actually participated in this year were some really cute pale green pattypan squash and a plethora of late blooming heirloom tomatoes. However, since farmer&#39;s market is only 2 blocks away, I&#39;m celebrating all the yumminess that my local farmers harvested this year.</p>
<p>One of my favorite parts about Thanksgiving is that there are so many leftovers that I get to eat thanksgiving sandwiches for every single meal over the post-thansgiving week. Jessica suggested we call these breakfast-lunch-dinner sandwiches since I literally have now eaten them for all of those meals today.</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty confident that anyone old enough to know how to use a computer already knows how to make a sandwich, but I&#39;ll give you a quick synopsis of how these are made.</p>
<ol class="steps">
<li>Cut a biscuit in half. You can use any kind of biscuit. I made heart shaped sweet potato biscuits.</li>
<li>Spread one half with mashed potaotes and the other half with gravy.</li>
<li>Layer the following: tofurkey, stuffing, brussel sprouts, and green bean casserole.</li>
</ol>
<p>Eat for EVERY SINGLE meal, until all ingredients are gone.</p>
