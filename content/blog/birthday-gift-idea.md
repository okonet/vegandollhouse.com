Sometimes birthdays sneak up on you, and you don't have time to go shopping for the perfect present. Sometimes google shopping express doesn't have the perfect present (\*gasp\*). Sometimes Amazon Prime doesn't ship fast enough for last minute birthdays...not that the birthday was last minute...the birthday is always on the same day every year...I'm not trying to blame the birthday for my inability to plan ahead here. This post is the solution to this exact problem...if the birthday girl in question happens to like quirky, yet well-appreciated and stylish gifts (thank you Erik's copywriting skills).

Here's how to do it.

Step 1. Find a jar. I just ate the last few olives that were in an olive jar in my fridge. Sometimes, people have cute mason jars lying around, but any old jar will do. Remove the label if there is one.&nbsp;Clean the jar and dry it really well.



Step 2. Make a new label for the jar. I made mine on the computer and printed it on label paper, but you can just draw on label paper or print one on regular paper and tape or glue it on. You don't even really need a label. This is basically optional.



Step 3. Write or type out the instructions to accompany the muffin mix. My instructions said this, but if you already know that your recipient has a muffin pan (bigger cubbies than cupcake pans), you can cusomtize the cooking time to 30-35 minutes for muffin-sized pans.

Step 4. Cut out a circle of fabric slightly larger than your lid, punch a hole in your instruction card, and cut a piece of ribbon long enough to wrap around the lid and tie in a bow.



Step 5. Make the muffin mix in two separate bowls.

Bowl #1: Sift together 2 cups organic unbleached flour, 1.5 tablespoons baking powder, and a half teaspoon of salt.

Bowl #2: Sift together 3/4 cup sucanat or coconut sugar, 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour, 1/2 tablespoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg,&nbsp;1/2 teaspoon ginger, and 1/4 teaspoon cloves.

Step 6. Layer the two mixes into the jar. Add chocolate chips at the top. These muffins taste great with a half bag of chocolate chips, but if you can fit more into your jar, then the muffins will probably taste even better!

Step 7. Optional: Bundle the muffin mix with the other necessary ingredients so that the birthday girl has everything needed to make them.
