I really like having cutely painted nails. This goes back to when I used to DJ at college radio stations, and it would make me happy to see my fingernails when I was running the board. Now it translates to seeing my fingers on the keyboard at work. It just makes me happier.

When I found out that not all nail polish was vegan, I looked online for a comprehensive list. To make things even more complicated, I don't really like to use a ton of chemicals, so I wanted to know which polishes are the least toxic.

This alphabetical list includes vegan nail polish that is cruelty-free and also free of at least 3 of the harmful toxins usually found. Each brand lists how many toxins the company excludes from their polish, 3-free being the minimum required to make it onto my list, and 7-free being the least toxic.

If you don't want to see the entire list and you're just interested in which ones are the best, so far, I recommend the following.

I compiled this list in 2015. If you have up-to-date information, please share it in the comments citing your source so that I can make sure my list is as accurate as possible.

Note: This list doesn't include brands (like wet n wild or julep) that have some vegan and some non-vegan.
