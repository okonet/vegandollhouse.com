          <h3><span>Day 1</span></h3>
<h4><span>The Theatre C</span>offee</h4>
<p>The first thing I consumed in Tokyo was a soy latte. I was in the Hikarie Mall, which is attached to the Shibuya train station. The mall has around 10 floors, and there are 3 coffee shops distributed around. The elevators in the mall have a really cute voice. I think the only other elevator I&#39;ve been in that talked to me was the Twitter building elevators, but this one was cuter because it was in Japanese. The mall also had a juice place which sold a lot of familiar american vegan snacks.</p>
<p>The first cafe we tried was on the bottom floor and looked a lot like blue bottle (so much that I&#39;m pretty sure they ripped off their logo, cups, and everything else about them), but they didn&#39;t offer soymilk. The second one was a success, so we never visited the 3rd one. </p>
<p>The Theatre Coffee made a really good soy latte with cute latte art, but it was a bit pricey.</p>

<p> </p>
<h4>Pure Cafe</h4>
<p>David had eaten dinner at Pure Cafe before and wasn&#39;t impressed with their food, so we decided to just order dessert only. It was one of the only places open before 11am, so it one the contest for next destination. The cheesecake was quite good. It used a peanut butter crust, which was unique.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Screen-Shot-2015-10-02-at-5.02.19-PM.png" alt="Vegan cheesecake at Pure Cafe"/></p>
<p>They also had gluten-free items, which Kimmy would have liked.</p>

<h4>Hanada Rosso</h4>
<p>Macrobiotic Vegan Restaurant</p>
<p><img src="/images/FullSizeRender.jpg" alt="Hanada Rosso"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Brown Rice Cafe</h4>
<p>100% vegan restaurant and organic when possible. This was mostly temple cuisine.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Day 2</h3>
<h4>Ainsoph. journey</h4>
<p>This salad parfait was so cute that I&#39;m going to start making these at home. The dressing that came with it was so delicious that if anyone at the restaurant spoke english, I would have tried to buy a bottle to take with me.</p>
<p><img src="/images/ainsoph.jpg" alt="salad parfait"/></p>
<p>David ordered some sort of marinara with rice.</p>
<p><img src="/images/ainsoph2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>I ordered pancakes with ice cream and whipped cream. The ice cream tasted like rum raisin. The garnish included some berries that had a fmailiar taste but didn&#39;t look familiar. The staff spoke very little english here, but the menu was partially in english.</p>
<p><img src="/images/ainsoph3.jpg" alt="vegan pancakes with whipped cream and ice cream"/></p>
<h4>Rainbow Bird Rendevous</h4>
<p>This was one of my favorite restaurants in Japan...quite possibly my very favorite. It&#39;s 100% vegan, GMO-free, and free of refined sugars.</p>
<p><img src="/images/rainbow-bird3.jpg" alt="Rainbow Bird Rendevous"/></p>

<p>Potato croquette</p>
<p><img src="/images/rainbow-bird4.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Veggie burger</p>
<p><img src="/images/rainbow-bird.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>This soft serve was the best one I had during my stay in Japan. Tokyo serves soft serve ice cream with cereal in it. This one had corn flakes. I&#39;ll be trying this at home.</p>
<p><img src="/images/rainbow-bird5.jpg" alt="Vegan soft serve"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Day 3</h3>
<h4><span>Harajuku</span></h4>
<p>Harajuku has a few people...like one or two.</p>
<p><img src="/images/harajuku.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>A lot of the malls in Tokyo had cute floors.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cute-floor.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<h4><span>Deus Ex Machina</span></h4>
<p>My favorite coffee shop in Tokyo was in Harajuku. It&#39;s called Deus Ex Machina. They have soy lattes and do cute latte art. Kurt thought it looked like lumpy space princess.</p>
<p><img src="/images/latte-art.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>A trend I noticed in &#34;hip&#34; coffee shops in Japan were copper piping sinks. I saw this in at least 3 different cafes.</p>
<p><img src="/images/copper-sink.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>One of the only times we got stuck eating at a restaurant that wasn&#39;t vegetarian and didn&#39;t have an English menu or any English speaking staff was in Harajuku. We ended up at a place called Oriental Recipe and Cafe that&#39;s around the corner from the Tamagachi store at the end of Takeshita-Dori.</p>
<p>Luckily, I pasted a bunch of Japanese characters into my journal before the trip so I could point to characters. The restaurant had a vegan salad or this vegan curry. </p>
<p><img src="/images/oriental.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>They also sold these really cute heart-shaped vegan snacks that we bought and ate later on our train ride to Okunoshima.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Giant Black Cat</h4>
<p>David read on twitter that there was a giant black cat in the Shinjuku train station puking out presents, so we obviously had to go to get souvenirs for Josipa. Here&#39;s a <a href="https://instagram.com/p/8agAFjqYWN/">flipagram</a> of our visit.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><span>Kuumba du Falafel</span></h4>
<p>I took a suggestion from <a href="https://instagram.com/kyliekelly/">Kylie</a> and went to Kuumba du Falafel for dinner. There&#39;s just one guy who works there and not much seating, but he spoke some English and was able to make us a falafel plate.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Day 4</h3>
<h4>Island Veggie</h4>
<p><img src="/images/island-veggie5.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>This vegetarian restaurant was recommended to me by <a href="https://instagram.com/eidlgonz/">Eidelyn</a>. I wasn&#39;t going to go because Happy Cow listed it as vegetarian, but she assured me that most things could be made vegan, so we went for breakfast. It was hard to find places open early in Japan because places typically open later and stay open later at night, so I was super excited that Island Veggie was open before 9am.</p>
<p>I ordered a chocolate peanut butter banana shake.</p>
<p><img src="/images/island-veggie3.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>David ordered a ham sandwich and it came with a free coffee. This sandwich was less than 700 yen, making this one of the most affordable options I found in Tokyo. </p>
<p><img src="/images/island-veggie4.jpg" alt="vegan ham and tomato sandwich"/></p>
<p><img src="/images/island-veggie2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>The decor inside was super cute too. And their bathrooms had the potty showers that we all come home from Japan missing.</p>
<p><img src="/images/island-veggie.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Tokyo Tower</h4>
<p><img src="/images/tower.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>The Tokyo Tower is only 1 or 2 stops away from Island Veggie, so we decided to check it out. The tower itself wasn&#39;t very interesting. It&#39;s a super tall tower. However, because it was in Tokyo, it had all this other cute stuff, like a One Piece themed cafe and store!</p>
<p><img src="/images/tower4.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p><img src="/images/tower3.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>I tried to go to the cafe, but they didn&#39;t offer soymilk. The word for soymilk is tonyu, so I basically just got into the habit of walking in everywhere and saying &#34;tonyu?&#34; None of the themed restaurants and cafes I tried to go to offered anything vegan.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tower2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p> Since we got denied at the cafe, there&#39;s a park nearby that we walked around in.</p>
<p> <img src="/images/tower5.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h4>La Petite Pattiserie de Mirayne</h4>
<p>This vegan bakery was a huge disappointment. Do not waste your time going here. The first time I went, they were closed. The second time I went, they were out of mostly everything. </p>
<p><img src="/images/bakery.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p><img src="/images/bakery2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>We got the black pepper crackers and the lemon cookies, and they were 1,000 yen for the tiniest containers! But after going all the way there twice (it was out of the way of everything else), we had to buy something. The pepper crackers had wayyyyy too much pepper. Here&#39;s Jack carrying the bag of overly priced baked goods.</p>
<p><img src="/images/bakery3.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h4> Lima</h4>
<p>Lima is a health food store with an almost all-vegan cafe. We came here to look for snacks for our trip to Bunny Island, but we ended up staying and eating lunch. I highly recommend this place.</p>
<p><img src="/images/lima.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p><img src="/images/lima2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p><img src="/images/lima3.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p><img src="/images/lima5.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p><img src="/images/lima7.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>And then after eating, we found all these snacks to bring with us to Bunny Island.</p>
<p><img src="/images/lima4.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h4>HangOut</h4>
<p>This all-vegan bar was so good that we came back twice! San Francisco really needs a vegan bar. The things I loved about this bar were that the food tasted better than bar food in the states (for instance, I ordered an amazing salad both times with watermelon radish and roasted kabocha squash), the employees spoke english, the menu was in English, and the menu had pictures so you knew what to expect.</p>
<p><img src="/images/hanguot.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Gyozas</p>
<p><img src="/images/hangout2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>The Bloody Mary didn&#39;t have a garnish, but at least I was able to order one at night.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tokyo-day7-10.jpg" alt="Vegan Bloody Mary at the Hangout in Tokyo"/></p>
<p>This rainbow salad could easily be the best salad I had in Japan.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tokyo-day7-11.jpg" alt="Rainbow Salad"/></p>
<p>Some type of mockmeat</p>
<p><img src="/images/tokyo-day7-12.jpg" alt="The Hangout in Tokyo"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Rilakkuma Store in Harajuku Kiddyland</h4>

<p><img src="/images/kiddyland3.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Day 5</h3>
<h4>T&#39;s Tantan</h4>
<p><img src="/images/TsTantan4.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>T&#39;s is located inside the Tokyo train station near the Keiyo street exit.</p>
<p><img src="/images/TsTantan2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>It&#39;s super clean and modern inside. They don&#39;t have a bathroom but the bathrooms in the train station are fairly clean. I got in the habit of carrying my own soap and washcloth in my purse since oftentimes the train station bathrooms didn&#39;t have soap or hand dryers.</p>
<p><img src="/images/TsTantan3.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>T&#39;s was probably the most affordable vegan place I found in Tokyo, so I ate here like 5 times. My first time was breakfast. Here&#39;s <a href="https://youtu.be/6JK8gVdKCoM">a video of me periscoping the inside of the restaurant</a>.</p>
<p>I ordered the shoyu ramen almost every time. It was just so delicious and perfectly filling. If you go for breakfast, you can add a coffee for 100 yen (around $1)!</p>
<p><img src="/images/TsTantan1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p> Across the hall and to the left is a bakery.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Boulangerie La Terre</p>
<p>They offer between 2 and 5 sweet and savory vegan options each day. It&#39;s all in Japanese, so you have to be able to communicate with the staff. By the end of my trip, I knew the words for butter, milk, eggs, meat, and fish, but I&#39;ve forgotten them all already.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Day 6</h3>
<h4>Tokyo Skytree</h4>
<p>Almost everyday in Japan was sunny and a perfect 70 degrees. However, the day we visited the Tokyo Skytree, it was a foggy day with a bit of rain.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tokyo-day6-3.jpg" alt="Tokyo Skytree"/></p>
<p>Luckily, the skytree is basically a huge 10 story indoor mall so we stayed warm and dry. The disney stores there are so much cuter than ours. There was a conglomeration between Disney and h. NAOTO to make a Nightmare Before Christmas line. </p>
<p><img src="/images/tokyo-day6-5.jpg" alt="Disney / h. Naota"/></p>
<p><span>I really wanted this bat purse, but it&#39;s too small to be practical.</span></p>
<p><img src="/images/tokyo-day6-4.jpg" alt="Nightmare Before Christmas purse"/></p>
<p>You probably think that the 4 Rilakkuma stores I&#39;ve already visited were enough. You&#39;re wrong.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tokyo-day6-6.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Who&#39;s hiding in the bushes?</p>
<p><img src="/images/tokyo-day6-7.jpg" alt="Totoro store"/></p>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>Sasaya Cafe</h4>
<p><img src="/images/tokyo-day6-8.jpg" alt="Sasaya Cafe"/></p>
<p>This was one of my favorite restaurants in Tokyo! They understood english well and had an english menu.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tokyo-day6-11.jpg" alt="Sasaya Cafe"/></p>
<p>They had a  good selection of desserts.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tokyo-day6-10.jpg" alt="Sasaya Cafe"/></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Day 7</h3>
<h4>Sol&#39;s Coffee</h4>
<h4><img src="/images/tokyo-day7-1.jpg" alt="Sol&#39;s Coffee"/></h4>
<p>These baristas were knowledgeable about SF coffee roasters like blue bottle.</p>
<h4><img src="/images/tokyo-day7-2.jpg" alt="Sol&#39;s Coffee"/></h4>
<p>I liked the cute mirror in the bathroom.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tokyo-day7-3.jpg" alt="Sol&#39;s Coffee"/></p>

<h4>Pokemon Center</h4>

<h4>Disney Store</h4>
<p>I like how the Disney store looked like a castle.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tokyo-day7-9.jpg" alt="Disney Store"/></p>
<p><img src="/images/tokyo-day7-8.jpg" alt="Disney Store Tokyo"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Day 8</h3>
<h4> </h4>
<p>Tomato was an awesome fabric store located in the Nippori district! It had a ton of cute fabrics, and the best part was that they played poppunk music while I shopped (Milencolin, Pennywise, etc.). Here are some of the cuter fabrics I spotted.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tokyo-day8-1.jpg" alt="Tomato Kawaii fabric"/></p>
<p><img src="/images/tokyo-day8-2.jpg" alt="Tomato kawaii fabric"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Komaki Shokudo</h4>
<p>This place was pretty disappointing. I wouldn&#39;t go back, and I would advise against going. The service was bad. The food was just whatever, except that it was quite expensive.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tokyo-day8-3.jpg" alt="Komaki Shokudo"/></p>
<p>After eating, we tried to visit some themed bars and cafes that were near the restaurant but nobody had soymilk, so we didn&#39;t stay. So, instead I had the fun time of trying to buy stamps and mail postcards and letters. And since you asked, yes, Tokyo does have stamps with Hello Kitty on them!!!</p>
<p><img src="/images/tokyo-day8-4.jpg" alt="Hello Kitty Stamps in Tokyo"/></p>
<p><img src="/images/tokyo-day8-5.jpg" alt="Tokyo"/></p>
<p>While at the airport, I made a list of things I would miss about Japan. One thing not listed is how much nicer the airport lounges are in Japan than in america. The food was labeled with allergies so I could determine some things that were vegan, and I made a mimosa.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tokyo-day8-6.jpg" alt="Things I will miss about Japan"/></p>
<p>Here were some of the souvenirs I bought myself in the Ueno district of Tokyo and other random places here and there.</p>
