So, I really like things that are cute and colorful. I try not to show favoritism between bright colors and pastel colors, but I will admit that when it comes to food, the bright colors catch my eye a lot more. A good example of this would be the difference between Let's Do Organic cake sprinkles and the rainbow sprinkles made by Lieber's. I know that the Let's Do Organic&nbsp;ones are better for me, but they're so light and barely noticeable when sprinkled atop white icing that I really prefer using the Lieber's. But then I end up only adding sprinkles to half of my cupcakes, so I don't have to actually eat the cute sprinkles. This is only one of the many slightly crazy things that I do, but it's worth noting, since it's kind of the inspiration for this endeavor.

While we're on this topic, can I just raise the issue of how disheartening it is that my favorite food is brown. Brown. The world has enough brown, don't you think?

Recently, I made a [rose cake](http://vegandollhouse.com/recipes/pistachio-rose-cake), and I was trying to use enough rose petal powder to make the cake pink. I must have added a quarter cup of rose powder, and then it was so light, that I ended up adding a drop of Wilton food coloring to get it to be pinker. It's only a drop, so I don't really feel too bad about using it once in awhile, but let's face it. If I could add colors to all of my foods without sacrificing the healthiness, I probably would. So, this is where the experiement of making my own food coloring began.

The rose petals did color the cake mix a bit, so that was good. But the reason it didn't dye it enough was because the powder was such a light pink color to begin with. So, what I needed was a darker pigment. I started thinking about what foods have dark pigments. Beets was the obvious first answer. Purple potatoes are pretty inside, but only before you cook them, and raw potatoes are a no-no. Carrots are pretty if you are looking for bright orange colors, which I rarely am, but since Halloween is coming up, orange could come in handy. Of course berries are really pretty too.

I decided to start the experiment with things I already had on hand before investing any additional money into this, just in case it turned out to be a disaster. I had beets and carrots in my fridge, so I peeled a few of each.

I don't know about you, but my ability to evenly slice fruits and veggies and basically anything is nonexistent. People always ask me how I can sew such a straight line. That's probably how a chef would feel if you asked them how they cut such uniform slices. "It's easy." Pshh. Luckily, I have kitchen tools to do my bidding, so I used my food processor on the slicing side. Then I laid all the slices out on my dehydrator trays.

I set the dehydrator to 125 degrees, which is what the excalibur recommends for veggies. I checked on them after 24 hours, and when I tried to snap a beet in half, it folded instead of snapping. I felt that they could be more dry, so I dried them for over 48 hours before taking them out. I imagine you could do this in an oven at a really low setting if you don't have a dehydrator, but I'm not sure what effect it would have on the color. If anyone has tried this, I'd love to hear about it!

When I got them out of the dehydrator, I started by using my blender to chop them into tiny pieces.

Since the blender wasn't able to grind it into the fine powder I was hoping for, I then transfered it into a coffee grinder.

Be careful when you take the lids off after making this, because the veggie dust in the air can go up your nose and make you sneeze. Look how filled with dust my blender is!

Now I have orange and red all-natural food coloring. Next will be my attempt at blue and purple.
