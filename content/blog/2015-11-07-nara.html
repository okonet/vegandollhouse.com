          <p>Oh. My. Gawsh. First Bunny Island and now a city that has wild deer walking around??? Can this country be any cuter?</p>
<p>Nara Park is where the deer hang out. It&#39;s not like they walk down the street and window shop like the rest of the tourists. I think they like the park because there&#39;s a guy selling crackers to humans for the humans to feed the deer. It&#39;s probably not the best thing for the deer to eat, but I bought 2 anyway. I know, I know. Worst Vegan Ever.</p>
<p>When I saw this sign, I started feeling like I didn&#39;t choose the right outfit for this adventure. The deerying (that&#39;s the word for when a deer bullies you) that I experienced wasn&#39;t even listed on the sign, so I guess they didn&#39;t consider it a danger. There was one deer in particular who kept trying to eat the bows off of my dress.</p>

<p>When you run out of deer crackers, they just look at you like they want more. It&#39;s sooooo sad. How could I not buy more?!</p>

<p>I did a periscope while I was there, and Ashley suggested that I should try to get hugs from the deer. Thanks Ashley!!!</p>

<p>This one is sticking his tongue out at me. I&#39;m not sure whyyyy....I&#39;m sure it has nothing to do with him being annoyed that I refused to purchase a third bundle of crackers.</p>

<p>Another cute thing about Nara is that everything in the town seems to be deer themed, from the stairs in the train station to the potholes in the roads.</p>

<p>When we were walking down the street, I learned that I&#39;ve been kneading dough the wrong way my whole life. Here&#39;s a <a href="https://youtu.be/BW0Zd7QEgW4">short video</a> of the way they do it in Japan.</p>
<p>For lunch, we found a vegan restaurant called Kinatei.</p>

<p>The meals were bento style and came with tea or coffee, but they didn&#39;t have any soymilk sadly.</p>
