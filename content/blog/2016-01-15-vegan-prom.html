          <p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Prom is only 2 months away, and I realized that I never even posted anything about it here. For those of you who read my blog, you know how good (bad) I am about updating it, so this should come as no surprise.</span></p>
<p>I&#39;m <span>quite lucky</span> to be on the vegan prom committee considering I have zero prom experience never having attended one, myself (unless that one time I dressed as a zombie and crashed my friend Laura&#39;s sister&#39;s prom counts).</p>
<p>One of the reasons I was excited to start a vegan prom in SF is that I never went to my own prom. Another reason is because...are you sitting down? IT&#39;S ALICE IN VEGAN WONDERLAND THEMED!!!!! It&#39;s as if someone created the perfect event just for me!</p>
<p>If you read my blog, you might be into some of the things I&#39;m into, which might mean that you&#39;re partially excited about this too. So, if you are, let me know about it!</p>
<p>You can find out everything you&#39;ve ever wanted to know about on the <a href="https://bayareasoiree.wordpress.com/">bayareasoiree.com</a> website. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bay-area-soiree-prom-done-vegan-tickets-20244443676">Tickets</a> are already on sale, and they&#39;re a great deal, considering you get free food and drinks once you&#39;re there. AND all of the proceeds benefit The Humane League!</p>
<p>If you decide to come, let me know so I can kiss your cute face! And probably dance together. And take pictures together. Okayyy..sappiness ending now.</p>

<p>The elegant vegan wrote the sweetest blog post about the vegan prom. Read it <a href="http://www.sfelegantvegan.com/blog/2016-sf-vegan-prom-benefiting-the-humane-league">here</a>.</p>
