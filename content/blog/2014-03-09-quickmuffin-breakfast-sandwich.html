          <p>The first time I ever had a vegan breakfast sandwich was at <a href="http://farmhouse.la/conf/2">Farmhouse Conf 2</a>. I already knew I loved <a href="https://twitter.com/veganstraightedge">Shane</a> from the moment I met him, but when I attended a conference at his house that was catered with 3 vegan meals plus snacks, Tonx coffee, and drinks, it sealed the friendship.</p>
<p>The second time I had a breakfast sandwich was just a couple of weeks ago at <a href="https://twitter.com/Timelesscoffee">Timeless Coffee</a>. While I was eating it, I decided that I would attempt to make breakfast sandwiches at home sometime. Today is sometime.</p>
<p>Whether you have already had 2 really amazing vegan breakfast sandwich experiences, or none (or 3,785), these are super crazy easy to make, and I think you should make them for someone you like very soon.</p>
<p>Grocery list:</p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Rudi&#39;s English Muffins (you can use any english muffins, but I try to buy organic whenever possible)</li>
<li>Daiya chive &amp; onion cream cheese (you can use earth balance if you don&#39;t like cream cheese)</li>
<li>Upton&#39;s seitan bacon (you can substitute with any vegan bacon - I like the <a href="http://www.tofurky.com/tempehproducts/marinated_strips.html">tempeh one</a> that Turtle Island makes)</li>
<li>Extra firm tofu</li>
<li>Diaya cheddar shreds</li>
<li>Lightlife sausage (This isn&#39;t organic, but it&#39;s the only one I have found that I like so far. If you know of a better one, please let me know!)</li>
</ul>
<p> Step 1: Toast the english muffin and spread cream cheese on both halves.</p>

<p>Step 2: Add 2-3 strips of cooked vegan bacon. I&#39;ve tried making the Upton&#39;s bacon in both a pan and the oven, and I didn&#39;t notice much difference either way.</p>

<p>Step 3: Add a tofu patty. I made these by squeezing the water out of a block of tofu and blending the tofu with a bunch of spices (cumin, turmeric, nutritional yeast, salt, pepper, garlic powder). Then spoon the blended tofu into a mold (cookie cutter) of some sort that you set onto a baking stone or cookie sheet. When you lift the cookie cutter, the tofu will hold its shape. You can also just make dollops and flatten them to around a half an inch in thickness. I baked these tofu patties at 350<span>º for 20 minutes, then sprinkled cheese on top and broiled until the cheese melted.</span></p>
