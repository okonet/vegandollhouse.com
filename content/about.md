My kawaii vegan lifestyle started 18 years ago when I learned about the abuse that animals endure in factory farms. The Vegan Dollhouse is powered by my love for animals, cute things, and lolita. 

The San Francisco bay area will always be my forever home. Iâ€™m inspired by pastel colors, cute dogs, and DIY everything.

I spend my time decorating food, making clothes, podcasting at Dolls & Doughnuts, organizing events (like vegan prom & tea parties), and periscoping.
