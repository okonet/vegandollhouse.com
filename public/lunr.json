        "content": "\n\n\n          Josipa&#39;s birthday 2013\n        \n\n        \n        \n          It&#39;s Josipa&#39;s birthday! Last year she requested the same cupcakes that I had made the month before for Jessica&#39;s birthday, which were apparently a big hit, however, Josipa deserves a new recipe for her birthday because she&#39;s the Cutest Croatian Cupie (C3) doll in the world!\nI was trying to decide what type of cupcake to make when I remembered a time forever ago (forever = approximately 6 years) that Josipa and I tried to make tiramisu. I say tried not because we didn&#39;t succeed in creating the dessert, but more because it was quite possibly the worst tiramisu in the history of tiramisu. Josipa is an excellent cook, and I&#39;m not the worst cook in the world, but somehow the Robinsipa combination failed. I&#39;m pretty confident that our failure was attributed to us both adding the required amount of baking soda, therefore causing the entire dessert to taste like a baking soda cake. Also, we doubled the recipe, so we were stuck with a ridiculous amount of this undesirable treat. So, I did what everyone does when they&#39;re stuck with too much of a bad thing. I brought it to work to pawn it off on my coworkers. If time travel is ever possible, I might use it to reverse that decision due to the relentless way my coworkers have teased me to this day. Basically, my takeaway from this (and I hope it&#39;s also a lesson learned vicariously through me for others reading this) is that if you&#39;re trying to sell people on veganism, don&#39;t introduce them to vegan food by feeding them something gross.\nI had been forming an idea in my mind for a few days of how I wanted to make these cupcakes so I headed to Whole Foods (and I coincidentally ran into the birthday girl in the banana aisle) for ingredients, where I was inspired by looking at their bakery case and seeing a tiramisu that was served in a cup made out of chocolate. It totally reminded me of the scene in Willy Wonka where he sips the tea out of the daffodil and then bites the cup. The only decision I hadn&#39;t yet finalized is what type of cup to serve it in since I would be layering it. So, I decided to try to make chocolate cupcake wrappers out of melted vegan chocolate chips by using a silicone pastry brush to paint a thin layer of chocolate in the inside of my silicone cupcake wrappers (they were very excited to be used twice in one day after a month or two of neglect).\n\nI left them in the freezer overnight to form the perfect level of resistance to the abuse that the placement of the tiramisu layers was sure to cause. Here&#39;s the hard part: taking them out of the silicone wrappers without damaging them. I had a 8/10 survival rate due to a learning curve. So, unless you have already participated in this activity, you should probably make more than you actually need since some will likely be casualties. The secret to doing this, I found, is to take only one at a time from the freezer so the others don&#39;t melt, loosen the wrappers from the chocolate all the way around the perimeter, and then turn the silicone wrapper inside out to get the chocolate cup to come out without breaking.\n\n\nI made the cupcakes with a vanilla cupcake recipe, subbing coffee and creamer for the milk traditionally used.\n\nOnce cooled, cutting the cupcakes in half horizontally created 2 coffee cupcake layers. The first layer is a dollop of chocolate mousse.\n\nThe second layer is cake.\n\nThe third layer is chocolate mousse.\n\nThe fourth layer is cake.\n\nThe last layer is cream cheese frosting.\n\nThe garnish is cocoa powder.\n\nHere&#39;s the birthday girl (a.k.a. C3) with her cupcake.\n\n\n        \n\n",

        "content": "\n\n\n          Halloween 2013\n        \n\n        \n        \n          Every single one of the seven years I have worked at Empirical, we have had a Halloween costume contest. I personally love the idea, even though I haven&#39;t ever won, because I like seeing my co-workers dressed up. However, this year, I decided to use a google survey to ask my coworkers what they wanted to do for Halloween. Not one single person voted for the conventional costume contest! They&#39;re over it. They wanted something new. The option receiving the most votes was to have a Halloween-themed food contest.\nSince Halloween is my favorite holiday and making themed food is my favorite way to cook, I was really excited to come up with something cute (cute is not another word for scary...I don&#39;t like scary food). So, I decided to make bats and pumpkin hummus.*\nLuckily, I had a photographer/assistant during this process because making bat crackers actually takes a lot longer than one might expect. It was as if I were genetically engineering real bats in my kitchen.\nYou can use any cracker recipe from the internet. I made one up, but I didn&#39;t think it was actually that tasty, so I won&#39;t share it with you. Once you roll the dough out as thinly as possible, you use your bat-shaped cookie cutter to make as many bats as possible.\n\nIf you don&#39;t dip the cutter in flour between each bat, the bats will stick into the cookie cutter each time like this.\n\nIf that happens, just push it out with your fingers.\n\nLay all your bats onto a baking stone. If you don&#39;t have a baking stone, get one. Until then, just place the bats onto a cookie sheet that&#39;s lined with parchment paper.\n\n\nWhile they&#39;re baking, you can start cutting out your nori. Place the cookie cutter on top of a sheet of nori on a cutting board.\n\nUse an exacto knife to cut around the cookie cutter.\n\n\nOnce the crackers have cooled, dip each nori bat into a bowl of nama shoyu (soy sauce) and then place on top of a cracker. I didn&#39;t get any pictures of this process because my photographer was busy cutting out bats, but you basically just smooth it over the top of the cracker with your finger until it sticks and then set the bat onto a cooling rack to dry.\nHere is a picture of the crackers and dip at my work lunch, along with some of the other Halloween-themed vegan foods that my co-workers made.\n\n\n\n\n\n* The hummus wasn&#39;t actually pumpkin flavored. I used carrot juice to make it orange and served it in a hallowed-out pumpkin.\n        \n\n",

Zen and Isabelle went through a pokemon stage a few years ago, and like most stages it faded away, and the Phamphey and Piplup jackets I made them went unworn. Then all of a sudden, after I had basically forgotten what the word pokemon meant, they came back to life--like little cute supernatural zombie creatures! Now all I hear about is charmander and houdour and celebi. So, it wasn&#39;t a huge surprise when I asked what kind of cupcakes Isabelle and Ashleigh wanted for their 12th birthday dance party, and they said the theme was pokemon.\nSince they didn&#39;t mind what flavor the cupcakes were, I made chocolate cupcakes with vanilla-almond icing.\n\nIsabelle had this black decorating icing leftover from her super cute Halloween Jack Skellington cupcakes that happens to be vegan by default (but not good for you, so use it sparingly).\n\nThe first step of making pokeballs is to make a premier ball. If you have any pokemon fans in your life, you may have been told what a premier ball is. If your attention span all of a sudden reduces from 1 hour to 2.3 seconds when someone starts talking about pokemon like mine does, then you probably don&#39;t remember what the difference between a regular pokeball and a premier ball is. I left one of the pokeballs as a premier ball because one of Isabelle and Ashleigh&#39;s friends doesn&#39;t eat red food coloring, so she got a special premier ball at the party.\n\nYou can buy red sugar from the store. I didn&#39;t. I like my organic raw, unbleached sugar, so I made my own red sugar.\n\n\nIf you don&#39;t have a mortar and pestle, you can just use a spoon and a bowl.\n\nI applied the red sugar to the pokeballs by spooning on spoonfuls while tilting the cupcakes over the bowl.\n\n\nHere are the birthday girls with their cupcakes.\n\n        \n\n",

I thought it was a day that celebrated an upsetting time in history by slaughtering millions of turkeys. However, I have now come to see that Thanksgiving is actually a day to celebrate 4 days off of work, quality time with family and friends (which apparently is now called friendsgiving, although I just discovered this yesterday so the PIC [people in charge] must have forgotten to send me the email informing me of the change), and a bountiful harvest. The only harvest I actually participated in this year were some really cute pale green pattypan squash and a plethora of late blooming heirloom tomatoes. However, since farmer&#39;s market is only 2 blocks away, I&#39;m celebrating all the yumminess that my local farmers harvested this year.\nOne of my favorite parts about Thanksgiving is that there are so many leftovers that I get to eat thanksgiving sandwiches for every single meal over the post-thansgiving week. Jessica suggested we call these breakfast-lunch-dinner sandwiches since I literally have now eaten them for all of those meals today.\nI&#39;m pretty confident that anyone old enough to know how to use a computer already knows how to make a sandwich, but I&#39;ll give you a quick synopsis of how these are made.\n\nCut a biscuit in half. You can use any kind of biscuit. I made heart shaped sweet potato biscuits.\nSpread one half with mashed potaotes and the other half with gravy.\nLayer the following: tofurkey, stuffing, brussel sprouts, and green bean casserole.\n\nEat for EVERY SINGLE meal, until all ingredients are gone.\n\n\n        \n\n",

You can substitute green beans if you don&#39;t care for asparagus.\nThe rice is just steamed brown rice with diced baby portabella mushrooms that were tossed in after about 20 minutes. The sauce is a simple teryaki sauce that my mommy taught me how to make that has only 4 ingredients: olive oil, tamari sauce, garlic, and ginger root.\n\n        \n\n",

I can only assume that the reason for this blatant LIE was the copious amounts of presents that children would receive on this particular occasion, as opposed to the infiltration of holiday-themed songs in every public location during the entire month or the abundance of fruitcake--quite possibly the worst dessert ever invented. Although I don&#39;t actually celebrate Christmas, I do think that the holiday has a few redeeming qualities. One is mistletoe, because well, who wouldn&#39;t love a parasite that encourages random make outs? But my favoritest thing about Christmas is decorating gingerbread houses! Michael&#39;s craft store actually sells a vegan-by-default gingerbread house kit, which I took advantage of last year since they went on sale for 99 cent just before New Years. However, I didn&#39;t actually want to eat it after enjoying its beauty for a few weeks, because although it was vegan, it definitely wasn&#39;t organic and probably wasn&#39;t very delicious either.\nEarlier this year, I was browsing a website filled with 3D printer blueprints, deciding on what fun things I could ask David to print for me when I found this. I&#39;m not sure who to credit for this brilliant idea (spindle_dev?), but I&#39;m pretty sure they had my things-Robin-would-wish-for-if-she-knew-they-existed list in their possession when inventing it. I&#39;ve been slowly transitioning my beliefs (mainly after years of hanging out with Pamela) that everything is cuter when it&#39;s been minified (except for dogs), so naturally, I couldn&#39;t wait to make these. I knew I had to at least wait until December, but in order to pass the time more quickly, I gave myself an appetizer task of making invitations to send to friends in hopes that they might like to join in on the gingerbread dollhouse decorating as well.\n\nI used a recipe from the PETA website to make the gingerbread and the glue (icing). Here are all the walls ready to go into the oven (pictured with the cookie cutter from the 3D printer).\n\nAnd here they are after coming out of the oven.\n\nThe 3D printer blueprint only produced a cookie cutter for one of the 3 pieces needed for this project, so I had to improvise with paper templates for the other 2. If I hadn&#39;t been on a deadline (and was smarter), then this method might have worked. However, I wasn&#39;t using my skills learned in woodshop class and therefore, there may have been a requirement for the gingerbread house construction workers to partake in some slight nibbling of 2 of the 4 walls while building their dollhouses. Nobody seemed to mind this task, with the exception of Josipa who seemed to think her nibbling-stopping willpower didn&#39;t stand a chance against the deliciousness of the gingerbread. We were all very proud of her for stopping before hers turned into a 2D gingerbread house, and for being the first builderette to produce a completed house! Her superior construction skills were no surprise, since she&#39;s the only one who actually owns a house and power tools and builds things (trellises, raised garden beds, etc.)\n\n\nSomehow Jessica (@jessicaspacekat) managed to take a lot of these pictures (although I may have also stolen a few from Instagram), while simultaneously making a super cute heart-shingled gingerbread mughouse. Here&#39;s what a mughouse looks like before it&#39;s decorated.\n\n\n\nThe gingerbread dolls living in this mughouse probably thought they were undergoing some sort of a natural disaster, but in actuality, Jessica just likes to dunk her biscuits and cookies into tea before eating them. I didn&#39;t think she would appreciate me posting the picture I took of her biting into the dollhouse, but it kinda reminded me of a sexier version of the rockbiter from neverending story.\nOur other event photographer was Jocelyn. Jocelyn (@jocelyntran) was quite qualified for this job, because she has experience in taking pictures of food for her food blog. She started off by showing you all the vegan decorations we were able to find for decorating these mini gingerbread houses.\n\nAll these wilton brand glitters and sparkles are vegan by default.\n\nEverything made by BioVegan is amazing, but you have to go to Berlin to buy them (or get someone who likes you a lot to smuggle them back for you when they visit).\n\nAnd here are some other random sprinkles that are vegan. These wilton ones and the little black balls are the only sprinkles I can find by Wilton that are vegan. If anyone knows of other tiny candies or sprinkles that are vegan that aren&#39;t pictured here, please send me links!\n\nLuckily for me and Emily, who were experiencing contruction catastrophes, Jocelyn came up with the brilliant plan of decorating her roof pieces before attaching them to the house! She&#39;s so smart!\n\n\nAlthough Emily&#39;s first house experienced an earthquake that registered 485760843085 on the Richter scale, her perserverance paid off. She learned some new tricks on roof construction before building her second house, and it came out beautifully! Not to our surprise, her gingerbread house was the dollhouse version of her very own hearts club cabin.\n\n\nAnother resident of the hearts club cabin not only volunteered her adorable home for this activity, but she also decorated a cute mini gingerbread sidecar house, while being an amazing hostess (even though she may have not so secretly wanted to be in bed).\n\nSomehow Jenn managed to escape the cameras and phones for the entirety of the day, so hers will not be displayed individually, but she made some amazing vegan brownies with walnuts to make up for it!\nWe had a visit by yet another Jessica (@jlsuttles) because one Jessica is never really enough, is it? Not only did she make the only burtonesque gingerbread dollhouse, but she also made the best looking and most structurally sound one. I was shocked at how amazing her mini gingerbread house looked and held up, considering she has never made one before (gothic or otherwise). If there had been prizes at this event, she would have gone home with more than just her gingerbread dollhouse.\n\nWe thought she might be done, but why be done when you can add mooooooore blaaaack.\n\n\nJessica was also accompanied by the lovely Justine who came all the way to SF from Ohio just to make her very first gingerbread house. There&#39;s a possibility she may have been visiting for other reasons as well, but let&#39;s be honest, when you make it to adulthood without ever having made a gingerbread house, do any other reasons even count?\n\n\nHere&#39;s a quick overview of the construction process of one of these cute little homes.\nYou start with 4 walls and 2 roof pieces.\n\nThen you glue the walls together. I advise cutting the smallest hole you can possibly cut in the (icing) glue baggie without the use of a magnifying glass.\n\n\n(Wearing tights that match the rug isn&#39;t a requirement.)\nHere is what it might look like once built, but not yet decorated.\n\nTo decorate, just add (icing) glue to any spot where you want to glue decorations.\n\n\n\nHere is the majority of the construction crew featured with our vegan gingerbread dollhouse sidecar mughouse neighborhood.\n\n\n\n        \n\n",

Pixelated hearts just always remind me of a heart in an old school video game, like when you&#39;re trying to see how much life your character has left.\nThey also remind me of Jessica&#39;s Pixel Pop Dev (former?) website that was full of cute things.\nThey also remind me of making things out of perler beads and how you can never fully get something to look the way you think it should unless you make it enourmous and buy 3874986 packs of perler beads, risking the cashier flagging you as a potential psychopath (which is why they have google shopping express...let someone else look like the psychopath for a change, right?). Perler bead hearts kinda resemble these watermelon radish pixel hearts.\n\nThe first time I ever tried to eat a watermelon radish, I didn&#39;t know that the skin was the part of it that made it spicy so I thought I would have to add them to the list of things I couldn&#39;t enjoy because of the well-known fact that I&#39;m a spice wuss. However, now that the secret has been revealed, I just peel and compost the outer eighth to a quarter of an inch. I know, I know, all the nutrition is in the peel, but if it&#39;s the difference between having this pretty root veggie in my life or not, I choose to sacrifice some of the nutrients. Besides, the other vegan snack I made for NYE were jello shots in the form of orange wedges, so after about 5 of those, concerns of nutrients tend to become less prominent.\n\nI made half the jello from a box and the other half from scratch using agar. I highly recommend only making it from scratch. It came out way better. Sidenote: one of the snacks we had was those chocolate covered sea salted almonds from TJ. If you haven&#39;t had these, you MUST get some. They are ridiculously delicious and also slightly addictive. And when I say slightly, I mean they are like crack. Delicious crack. Is TJ still open?\n\n        \n\n",

I&#39;ve never classified myself as one of these people (mostly because I don&#39;t know how to read), until 2014 apparently.\nI first heard about the Imgur cupcake collaboration through a text message. I hadn&#39;t heard of Imgur (although a week later, I realized I had been visiting the site through the Reddit awwwww section and didn&#39;t even realize it), so naturally, I read it in whatever pronunciation made sense in my warped little mind, which was obviously Im-Grrrrr. It wasn&#39;t until a few days ago when I was corrected by a 15 year old (of course). Now the Imguraffe part makes so much more sense!\nSince I happen to think that fondant tastes horrible, I decided to make the upvote arrows out of sugar cookies dipped in royal icing. I&#39;ll be posting the recipe soon, but here are a few pictures of the process.\n\n\n\n\nAs much fun as these were to create, I think the cupcakes had even more fun on their field trip to Imgur, judging by the pictures in their blog post. I hope that next time, I can accompany my cupcakes on their adventures...it&#39;s been too long since I fed a giraffe.\n\n        \n\n",

I already knew I loved Shane from the moment I met him, but when I attended a conference at his house that was catered with 3 vegan meals plus snacks, Tonx coffee, and drinks, it sealed the friendship.\nThe second time I had a breakfast sandwich was just a couple of weeks ago at Timeless Coffee. While I was eating it, I decided that I would attempt to make breakfast sandwiches at home sometime. Today is sometime.\nWhether you have already had 2 really amazing vegan breakfast sandwich experiences, or none (or 3,785), these are super crazy easy to make, and I think you should make them for someone you like very soon.\nGrocery list:\n\nRudi&#39;s English Muffins (you can use any english muffins, but I try to buy organic whenever possible)\nDaiya chive &amp; onion cream cheese (you can use earth balance if you don&#39;t like cream cheese)\nUpton&#39;s seitan bacon (you can substitute with any vegan bacon - I like the tempeh one that Turtle Island makes)\nExtra firm tofu\nDiaya cheddar shreds\nLightlife sausage (This isn&#39;t organic, but it&#39;s the only one I have found that I like so far. If you know of a better one, please let me know!)\n\n Step 1: Toast the english muffin and spread cream cheese on both halves.\n\nStep 2: Add 2-3 strips of cooked vegan bacon. I&#39;ve tried making the Upton&#39;s bacon in both a pan and the oven, and I didn&#39;t notice much difference either way.\n\nStep 3: Add a tofu patty. I made these by squeezing the water out of a block of tofu and blending the tofu with a bunch of spices (cumin, turmeric, nutritional yeast, salt, pepper, garlic powder). Then spoon the blended tofu into a mold (cookie cutter) of some sort that you set onto a baking stone or cookie sheet. When you lift the cookie cutter, the tofu will hold its shape. You can also just make dollops and flatten them to around a half an inch in thickness. I baked these tofu patties at 350º for 20 minutes, then sprinkled cheese on top and broiled until the cheese melted.\n\nStep 4: Add cooked sausage. \n\n        \n\n",

If you arrive at midnight, like I did, you may opt to stay the night at one of the airport hotels and head to London in the morning. In addition to the benefit of going to sleep sooner, the hotels by the airport are also cheaper than the ones in London. I chose the Radisson Blu, because hotels.com had a room with free wifi and breakfast.\nAfter chatting with a local on the airport escalator and determining that Londoners don&#39;t drink the tap water, my first purchase upon arriving to the UK was a bottle of water from the hotel bar that cost the equivalent of $7.50. It was bottled on an organic farm in Wales, but for $7.50, I&#39;m picturing it being bottled by baby lambs, which makes me feel okay about the cost.\n\nNormally, I assume that I’ll be lucky to find an apple, some orange juice, and a bowl of oatmeal when American hotels offer free breakfast, but this was more like dining with a royal family compared to that. They had a ridiculous buffet of every breakfast item you could imagine, but even more because it was a traditional english breakfast (so, add fried tomatoes, sauteed mushrooms, baked beans, etc.) There were a surprising number of vegan options, and they even had raw sugar and soy milk for the cereal and coffee.\n \nAfter a 45 minute train ride with a beautiful view of the countryside along the way, the next stop was to check in to our new hotel (The Wesley) and head to Camden Town. There may have been 2 unsuccessful attempts to rent bikes (Sheep seemed to have zero problems doing it last time) before deciding to walk. I feel so lucky that the weather is gorgeous and sunny with no rain during my stay. Last time I visited, I remembering it being much colder and somewhat wetter.\nThe only vegan restaurant I could find that served a traditional english breakfast on a Thursday was inSpiral Lounge, but I do not recommend it. They were out of sausage and told us they would sub bacon, but instead they subbed eggplant. The tofu scramble and sauteed mushrooms were good, but the rest wasn&#39;t worth a damn...especially not for $15. The baked beans tasted like they mixed a can of navy beans with a can of tomato sauce.\n\nIn addition to the mediocre food, a number of other factors turned me against inSpiral Lounge which include, but are not limited to their inability to run my credit card, their non-existent wifi that they claim to have, and an extremely difficult secret password (written in invisible ink?) process of using the loo.\nAfter leaving inSpiral, I knew only one thing could make me feel better...Cookies and Scream.  \n\n\nLast time I was in London (2 years ago), I tried to go here for an espresso milkshake, but they were closing by the time I got there, so I had to order something else. I&#39;ve been waiting this entire time for the espresso shake, and it did not disappoint!\n\nWe may have also ordered a mint brownie to take back to the hotel for later. Can you blame us? Just look at them!\n\nYou&#39;d think after all of that, the pigginess would end, but nooooo. We stopped at the Holland &amp; Barret health food store in Camden Town to check out their vegan section.\n\nI wish our hotel room had a fridge, so I could have bought one of everything, but instead I only bought some cheezly to eat with crackers in the hotel. I&#39;ll have to eat it all really fast since there&#39;s no fridge...life is so hard. I wanted to get the cheddar, but David is more of a risk taker than I am, so he talked me into trying the edam kind. I don&#39;t even know what it is, so I&#39;ll report back once I taste it.\n\nAlso, what&#39;s up with Tofutti playing favourites??? They don&#39;t make these flavors of cream cheese for us! Nor do they make cute little single serving sized packages for us! I don&#39;t know about you, but I never manage to get through an entire package of cream cheese, so these little baby sized ones would be perfect for me. I could take them to work, travel with them, hide them for easter (would that be weird?), the list goes on. Who wants to help me write some letters to Tofutti?\n\nManna was my favorite vegan restaurant in London. They claim to be the oldest vegetarian restaurant in the city, so it must be their years of experience that has made them so awesome! I ordered the bangers and mash since it&#39;s supposed to be London&#39;s specialty (like ordering curryworst when you&#39;re in Berlin). It consisted of a layer of mashed potatoes, topped with a layer of gravy-marinated kale, topped with 2 delicious house-made sausages, and to my surprise and happiness, was topped with onion rings! All of this floated in a sea of gravy. I loved it! The mashed potatoes were made with dill, which gave them a potato-salad-like taste that was quite refreshing. The coating on the onion rings was much lighter than the veggie grill onion rings, making them seem a bit closer to a tempura onion ring. The sausage was divine. The flavor was perfect, with just the right amount of sage and the consistency didn&#39;t taste like meat, so it was great for someone who doesn&#39;t like eating mock sausage that has that gristly substance to it.\n\nDavid ordered the polenta, which looked so pretty on the plate due to the addition of beets and kale.\n\nFor dessert, I was excited to see petite fours on the menu. I&#39;ve only had vegan petite fours once before which is when Jessica and Pamela made them for my birthday tea party. I&#39;ve seen them often when having tea with non-vegans, so I&#39;ve come to have an expectation of what they should look like. I will admit that I was slightly disappointed when the petite fours arrived to our table and looked like this.\n\nHowever, they were still delicious the next day when we ate them with tea in our hotel room. The other aspect of Manna that made it so awesome (other than the amazing food) was the decor. They had this really cute wallpaper with birdies hanging out in trees, and the ceiling lights were made to look like tree branches.\n\nDay 1 came to a close with one last tube ride back to the hotel. I felt like I spent 25% of Day 1 on the underground. My synopsis of the tube is that it smells better than the metro in NYC, but it still has a weird underground basement smell that I&#39;m not fond of. \n\nWe decided that for the rest of the London vegan adventure, we would try to stay above ground as much as possible.\n        \n\n",

        "content": "\n\n\n          Vegan tea time in London\n        \n\n        \n        \n          I love tea parties! I’ve had a couple in my backyard, one in a park, and have visited a few tea houses (Darteeling, Crown &amp; Crumpet, and Petunia&#39;s) in San Francisco and Portland. I love how all the food is cute. The only time I have actually been to a high tea was at the Stanford Inn. They offer an all-vegan high tea every day for their overnight guests, and it’s divine! They give you a choice of coconut or soy creamer for your tea, and I have only been once, but I would love to go again! (They’re also doggie friendly if you have a pooch in your life who you would like to invite to high tea.)\nEven though I noticed that every hotel we stayed at in London had a tea station set up in every room, I would never have thought to go to high tea while visiting there. It wasn’t until I saw Ashley’s instagram post from her afternoon tea at The Savoy that I even realized it was a possibility to have vegan afternoon tea in London.\nSo, I started doing some research to see if there were other places to have vegan afternoon tea as well. While none of these are strictly vegan places, they all offer a vegan tea option. Here is a quick synopsis of what I discovered. I’m ordering this list by the ones that looked the best to the least attractive.\n\nLe Chandelier in Dulwich: £18/person, but outside of London (30 minutes by car, 60 minutes by bus)\nThe Promenade at the Dorchester: £45/person; vegan menu options include the following\nSandwiches: Rocket salad and hummus, Grilled Mediterranean vegetables, Cucumber and cress\nPastries: Fruit salad, Dark chocolate mousse, Vegan Carrot cake, Orange jelly with raspberry\n\nFlemings Mayfair London: £25/person\nClaridges: £50/person\nPalm Court at The Langham: £38/person for unlimited sandwiches, cakes, and tea refills\nDiamond Jubilee Tea Salon at Fortnum &amp; Mason: £44/person and the vegan menu is online\nLanesborough hotel: They were closed for renovations in April 2014, so I wasn’t able to find out how much they charge\nThe Savoy Hotel: £45/person (below is a picture of their dessert, taken by @ashleythevegan) \nCoworth Park in Ascot: I didn’t inquire as to the cost of this one, because it was so very far outside of London, but I did see a delicious looking picture posted by VeganLuke.\nConnaught: £41/person\n\nSo, after staying up until 3am doing all this research (I’m not so good at adjusting to new time zones when traveling), in the end I decided not to participate in high tea while visiting London. Here is some of the supporting evidence in my decision.\nI was already feeling like $45/person for tea time was a bit steep until I used my currency calculator to determine that 45 pounds is actually 75 dollars!!! For one person! And the pastries aren’t even garnished with gold! \nThere’s a lot of controversy on the internet about whether or not vegans should support these places by giving them our hard-earned money. While it’s great that they cater to vegans (and gluten-free diets), they also serve Foie Gras on their menus. As someone who experiences cross contamination issues about 25% of the time when dining at omnivore establishments, I tend to opt for all-vegan places whenever possible. \nSo, the next 5 days in London will probably consist of me mentally (and quite possibly in blog format as well) converting all my purchases into how they compare to a vegan afternoon tea (or portion thereof).\nSince I’m not yet in London and still waiting patiently at the boarding gate, I will begin this comparison by using the 75 pounds that I saved to go back to the Stanford Inn, look at llamas, enjoy their complimentary vegan tea, and order a vegan white russian during their happy hour. \n        \n\n",

        "content": "\n\n\n          Spring Break: London (Day 2)\n        \n\n        \n        \n          Day 2 of the London Vegan Adventure began with a complimentary breakfast at the Wesley Hotel. Similar to the Radisson&#39;s breakfast, this was an extravagant traditional english breakfast. Since the chef was actually cooking right there out in the open, I was able to ask him what items were vegan, and I ended up being able to eat a pretty decent variety. They also had soy milk and organic sugar for the coffee. Also, is it just me or does all the coffee in London taste watered down? When I was in Spain, it all tasted twice as strong, and in London, it all tasted half as strong. Is this a geographic preference? I wonder what people from other countries think of San Francisco coffee.\n\nAs they say, the third time is a charm. We finally found a bike station that we could figure out how to obtain bikes from! So, we rode to Oxford Street, returned the bikes, and walked around shopping and people watching. I got a bag full of stuff from Primark since the last time I was in London, I found some really awesome stuff. I got a really cute tote bag with unicorns and stars all over it, as well as a lot of tights for myself and friends. Then, I visited what I believe to be the equivalent to our Starbucks called Pret Managre, only it&#39;s superior to Starbucks because it&#39;s organic. I enjoyed a latte with the mint brownie from Cookies N Scream.\n\nIn a record store, I saw that London has a dance night called Blow Up too! I don&#39;t actually know if SF still has theirs since I haven&#39;t been in years, but the one in London actually looks better. Too bad I was so sleepy on Saturday night that I opted out of going.\n\nBeetroot is either vegetarian or vegan and kind of reminded me of a mall food court Loving Hut in that they have a bunch of already hot food bar items that you can order take out from, but they also make smoothies and fresh juices. I ordered the Beatnik juice, since it was the only one with beets in it, and I figure if I&#39;m at a place called Beetroot, I should probably be drinking beetroot juice.\n\nThere was a clothing store called Monki that had the cutest decor that I had to go inside. Too bad the clothes weren&#39;t cute at all. But look at this adorableness that housed the inferiorly aesthetic clothing.\n\n\n\nAfter another successful bicycle transport, we arrived at Regent&#39;s Park where they had rows of cherry blossom trees as far as the eye could see.\n\nThe cheese and cracker picnic would have been better if the crackers didn&#39;t taste like styrofoam, but I counterbalanced that problem by increasing the cheezly to cracker ratio to 80:20.\n\nThere&#39;s a portion of Regent&#39;s park called Queen Elizabeth&#39;s circle that is supposed to have something crazy like 20,000 roses, but of course, they were all just rose branches in April so instead we found a mini waterfall.\n\n\nNext stop was a vegan boutique that Ashley told me about called Vx. \n\nIt was super tiny, but they had a good variety. I bought some stuff that I didn’t take pictures of, and I tried to buy these adorable shoes, but they didn’t have them in my size. Waaaahhhh!\n\nThey had some cheese there called Teezini that I really wanted to get, but our hotel didn’t have a fridge, so I didn’t get it. &lt;/3\n\nI was crazy excited that they had vegan eclairs because the only time I’ve ever had one was at Millennium, so it was probably a million dollars for one. Sadly, however, the filing tasted nothing like eclair filling, so I’m back to my mission to search the planet for a decent vegan eclair.\n\nWe met up with friends at a pub called Public Bar in Soho where they served Samuel Smith’s. All their beers were marked as vegan, except 2. They even had a statement on their menu about how their brewery was the first one to register with the Vegan Society (is that the same as the secret society of vegans that Ashley is now an honorary member of?).\n \nDavid ordered the chocolate stout, which with an exception of the smell, was barely a distant relative of chocolate. Although, I guess it tasted more like chocolate than that time Jessica convinced me to taste her beer that she insisted tasted like candy when we were at the Belgian bar in the Tenderloin in SF.\n\nThe girl sitting next to me had a really gorgeous purplish reddish drink, which she told me was called a black cider. It’s apparently cider mixed with black currant juice. How could I resist trying that?! It was delicious! This picture isn’t the best (I blame Ernesto) for showing the pretty color of this beverage, but trust me that it looked as pretty as it tasted.\n\nMildred&#39;s was only 2 doors down from Public Bar, which was super convenient. Mildred’s almost always has a wait, so if you decide to go there, you should put your name on the list, and then go to Public Bar for a black cider while you wait. \n\nI ordered a drink called pornstar, which had a half of a passion fruit floating it. (Sorry I didn’t take a picture.) I think this could be the first time I have ever tried passion fruit fresh. I didn’t like the consistency of the seeds at all, and considering that it doesn’t have a square millimeter that is seed-free, I think this may be the kind of fruit that I will only be enjoying in smoothies forevermore. \nThe appetizer was dumplings with this really yummy dipping sauce that I couldn’t replicate or describe in any amount of articulation (besides yummy).\n\nMy dinner was the mushroom pie, which was a bunch of different kinds of mushrooms in a wine reduction sandwiched between 2 layers of “crust” made from phyllo dough. It came with mashed peas sprinkled with dill (delicious) and a combination of mashed white and sweet potatoes. I’m not a huge fan of things cooked in wine, so I probably won’t order this again, but it was still yummy, and our server commented on how happy I looked so I must have been enjoying myself.\n\nThe end of Day 2 landed us at a bar called Borderline for a dance night called Bedrock. In spite of the website describing it as Yeah Yeah Yeahs and LCD Soundsystem type music, as well as the fact that Blanca recommended it as being fun, it was the most bro-ey, non-fun dance night that I have visited in a long time. Note to self: When on vacation, stick with pubs.\n        \n\n",

Things that make this place so amazing include the following.\n\nSuper cute and sweet staff: I was so enamoured by the selection that I probably asked way too many questions that would have led any San Francisco cafe staff member to pierce my soul with a stare of hatred, but here I got not only patience, but I actually learned things! For instance, the sausage they serve with their English breakfast was so delicious that I had to ask what kind it was. I learned all about how Paul McCartney (yes, of The Beatles!) has a vegetarian family, and his daughter has a line of vegetarian/vegan mock meats! This, of course, led me on a journey to try to find the sausages to take back to Spain. I may have also acquired some frozen sausages wrapped in pastry puff that were soooo goood!\nAdorable decor: This ranges from the doilyesque furniture to the tattoo font on the menu chalkboards, to the flash art sheets in themes of cupcakes and sweets, to the EVERYTHING! For proof, see the one million pictures I&#39;m about to post below.\nAll-vegan menu: By the name, you might assume that they serve cake and tea. They actually have so much more. Of all the traditional English breakfasts I had while in London (there were 4), this was by far my very favorite! Their coffee menu was more extravagant than Starbucks. I don&#39;t mean this as an insult. It actually reminded me of the flavor options at one of my favorite cafes in the U.S. (Grindcore House in Philly). They had 4 milk options! They also had vegan snickers bars.\nCustom cakes: While I&#39;m not really a fan of fondant, they had the cutest vegan cake that was themed after Corpse Bride!!! As if they hadn&#39;t already won me over.\n\n\n\n\nWho has a teapot shaped chalkboard? Seriously???\n\n\n\n\n\nMocha and Caramel Latte made with oat milk.\n\n\nI know that going to a chain when you&#39;re traveling is boring. You should try to experience new places as a local. However, that being said, going to chains to see the differences can be neat. For instance, Starbucks in Spain all have fresh squeezed orange juice. I love that! So, I was excited to go to a Whole Foods in London to see what foods they had that were different. It was basically ALL of them. I was most excited by the vegan cheese section, where I acquired some Vegusta to bring back to Spain. It was a new kind I had never had before with herbs in it. Here are some pictures I took of the rest of the cheeses that Whole Foods had.\n\n\n\n\nMy best find at Whole Foods was organic Hello Kitty pasta!!! I wanted to buy 127649598 of them, but luggage space is always an issue when traveling, so I could only get 4. It might also have been because there were only 4 packages left on the shelf.\nTesco stores aren&#39;t really anything special. They&#39;re kind of like the equivalent to Safeway in northern California or Ralph&#39;s in southern California. However, we had to go there to find the sausages, and they had a number of other cute and/or yummy vegan things.\n\n\n\nItadaki Zen is an organic and vegan japanese restaurant. It differs from Cha-Ya in that it seems more authentic. This authenticity is not only obvious in the food options, but also in the fact that there is a zen garden inside of the restaurant.\n\n\nAfter leaving London and arriving in Zaragoza, Spain, I saw this sign in the airport. I feel like this sign should just be posted everywhere all the time.\n\n        \n\n",

        "content": "\n\n\n          Pressed Salad\n        \n\n        \n        \n          Apparently, the new craze in salad these days is pressed salad. I hadn&#39;t ever had one before making this one, so it was kind of an experiment. I&#39;ve only been hearing about them for the past month or so. From what I understand, it&#39;s sort of similar to the process of making sauerkraut, so it has a lot of the same health benefits, even though it only has about an hour to ferment.\nI used to make sauerkraut before I worked so much. I heard from someone who stayed at the hippocrates institute to combat cancer that they serve sauerkraut with every meal. Once I found that out, I started making it, because cabbage is cheap, but raw sauerkraut is usually quite pricey. If you google the reasons why sauerkraut is good for you to eat regularly, you&#39;ll find more reasons than you&#39;ll be able to read in a day. They range from digestive aids to glowing skin to natural antibiotics to increased enzyme count to diminishing the craving for sweets and on and on and on.\nMost pressed salad advocates talk about how they&#39;re easier to digest than regular salad, but that could be said for the chopped salad as well. Remember the last salad fad? The New York restaurants chopped up the salad ingredients so tiny that you didn&#39;t even really know what was in your salad. The upside, though, is that it would decrease the amount of work your body has to do with chewing and digesting.\nSo, I guess the real question is, when you&#39;re pressing salad for only an hour, is that even enough time for your salad to grow any probiotics? Chi Energy says you can get probiotics from only 10-15 minutes of pressing your salad. What do you all think?\nAll you have to do to make this is chop up your salad ingredients, massage them with salt (like you do when you make kale salad), and press into a glass or ceramic vessel (traditionally sauerkraut is made in a crock, but you can use anything in your kitchen really). Top with another glass or ceramic dish and then top with something really heavy to push all the air out. I used some little heart ceramic dishes I got from Daiso for only $1.50 each.\n\n\nOnce you have your pressed salad, you just top with your favorite dressing. I used lemon juice only, but I think next time I&#39;ll use gomasio and nutritional yeast as well.\n  \n        \n\n",

Now, it&#39;s finally time to stop complaining (well, not completely, I mean I am me after all) and start bragging. Well, bragging is such an icky word. Let&#39;s instead use the phrase talking-about-how-much-better-the-new-dollhouse-is-than-the-old-one.\nIn my mind, the warming of the new dollhouse really started when Jessica came over and taught me how to use my fireplace and was the first to take a bath in my jacuzzi tub while enjoying a fire. However, the official dollhousewarming was this past weekend when 30 of the best people I know came and visited and shared in my excitement. And it wouldn&#39;t have been a complete housewarming weekend if we hadn&#39;t had our inaugural movie night tonight by watching The Addams Family on the big screen (that just happens to retract into the ceiling when not in use so we aren&#39;t tempted to watch movies when we should be doing more productive things on a nightly basis).\nThe dollhousewarming preparations started on Friday night when Ashley came over after work to help make dollhouse-shaped cookies. She even stayed up past her bedtime until we were all finished because she&#39;s such a trooper!\n\n\n(Thanks Jocelyn for having enough restraint to take this cute picture of your cookie before you ate it!)\nSaturday morning, we made strawberry lemonade and strawberry lemonade sangria with heart shaped strawberries floating in the pitchers. To garnish the drinks, we had strawberries with umbrellas in them for placing on the edge of the glasses. Mia said the party looked like a vegan etsy party, so she coined the term vetsy to describe it.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the sangria, David made bloody marys with cute garnishes too. Bloody Marys are kind of his specialty. He even makes his own vegan worcestershire from scratch.\n\nI made taco bowls. I didn&#39;t really know how this would turn out, due to the fact that I had never attempted this before (and many years of supporting evidence that even when things turn out really cute in my head, the execution isn&#39;t always so exquisite).\n\nThis was probably the best party I&#39;ve been to in over a year. I love my friends and family! Would it be weird to have a dollhouse-iversary every year around this time? Don&#39;t answer that. I&#39;ll just pretend the answer is no.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n",

So, when she asked for strawberry shortcake as her birthday dessert, I immediately started brainstorming how I could make it as cute as her. Okay, that&#39;s not possible, but I at least had to try. Strawberry shortcake has this connotation, for me at least, as being this hard biscuit with shapeless pieces of strawberries strewn about, and a glob of whipped cream. It&#39;s not an attractive dessert. The colors are nice, but that almost always happens when you&#39;re willing to sacrifice taste (ahem, chocolate) for looks (brown is just not a cute color, pretty much ever).\nSo, after a lot of brainstorming, I finally narrowed it down to 3 possibilities. Keep in mind, this dessert will be served at a bar, so it can&#39;t be a big beautiful layered cake with perfect triangle slices on cute colored plates with bamboo utensils. This isn&#39;t that kind of birthday party. It has to be a low-maintenance, easy-to-sneak-into-somewhere-if-needed, easy-to-consume type of dessert.\nSo, the 3 finalists: 1) layered in small mason jars, 2) A swirl roll, but I&#39;ll have to put it on a lollipop stick or skewer to keep it from being too messy to eat, or 3) Bite sized strawberry shortcake hors d&#39;oeuvres. Okay, while I know Jessica likes the swirl and would very much appreciate it, I don&#39;t think I want my first time experimenting with something difficult to be on her birthday. So, now I have it narrowed down to 2. Since I don&#39;t yet have a dishwasher(!!!), I think I&#39;ll choose #3!\nThe plan is to make biscuits (that aren&#39;t too hard) and to use the cute scalloped cookie cutters that I borrowed from Jessica to cut out cute bite-sized biscuits. Then I&#39;ll cut each strawberry into heart shapes. Then I have to attempt to make a whipped cream that will hold up outside of the fridge for a number of hours (this is the real challenge!).\n I think I nailed it.\nThe scalloped heart biscuit...\n\nThe whipped cream that held up to piping, and even stayed throughout the night.\n\nThe heart shaped strawberry slices held together with heart toothpicks.\n\n\nSo, that was part 1 of the Jessica birthday weekend. Part 2 consisted of a tea party at the Crown &amp; Crumpet pop-up shop in New People Mall. I&#39;ve only ever been to the big Crown &amp; Crumpet for Jessica&#39;s half birthday one year, so this was a bit different, but it did not disappoint! Our server, or as they call them &#34;Trolly Dolly&#34; was a super cute punk rock girl with colored hair and an adorable voice. Even though, I brought my own creamer (they offer soymilk, but I am really partial to the coconut creamer by so delicious) and my own daiya cheese for the tri-colores sandwich (It&#39;s vegan if you just have them make it without the mozzarella, but I&#39;m a piggie and I wanted the cheese on it), our Trolley Dolly still said I was the best vegan she&#39;s ever had!!! That is the first time anyone has ever said that to me. I can die now.\nHere&#39;s a picture of my plate. The house salad is vegan by default.\n\nAnd the adorable birthday girl, Jessica.\n\nAnd what would a trip to Japantown be without an obligatory trip to Pika Pika?\n\n        \n\n",

I follow on instagram made her own butter from scratch! I didn&#39;t even realize that was something people did. I thought you either bought earth balance or you didn&#39;t use butter. Those were the 2 options in my mind. I&#39;m so naive.\nSo, upon a quick google search, I realized that many people are making their own vegan butter. Why am I always the last person to hear about these things?! I followed this recipe exactly, but I think I&#39;ll make a few changes in the future. I used a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar, because I don&#39;t have (nor have I ever heard of) coconut vinegar. And I used the liquid soy lecithin, because I prefer the taste (or lack of taste I should say) over the dry. \nThe recipe suggested using Tovolo ice cube molds, but who wants square shaped butter? Squares, that&#39;s who. I used some star-shaped silicone molds. You can use anything really. You can even just use your leftover earth balance tub from when you run out.\n \n\n        \n\n",

        "content": "\n\n\n          Art and Wine Festival\n        \n\n        \n        \n          After attending a couple of vegan beer fests and jpop summit recently, I told myself to start avoiding activities where there are large amounts of people. This epiphany was based on a couple of factors, one being the fact that I don&#39;t really care for other humans, and the other being that I don&#39;t have the patience to wait in long lines before getting what I want.\nSo, when I found out there was an art &amp; wine festival a few blocks from my house, I was a bit hesitant to attend. However, the thought of walking around carrying my polka dotted wine glass helped me get over any doubts I may have had. Since I wasn&#39;t sure what vegan wine options there would be, we started our walk with a glass of wine from home called Barrel 27 High on the Hog from 2010.\nUpon arrival, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn&#39;t as crowded as the events that had scared me away from attending such festivals. There was far more art than wine for sure, and the only vineyard I actually talked with was Bonterra, where I discovered that their white wines are vegan, but not their reds. Another benefit of their winery is that they&#39;re not only organic, but biodynamic. I think I might visit their winery next time I&#39;m in Mendocino. In case you&#39;re ever unsure whether a wine is vegan, and you don&#39;t have the opportunity to talk with the winery in person, the barnivore website is a good resource (they also have a phone app called vegaholic).\nSome of the art we saw that we liked included a woodworking booth where we bought the cutest cutting board and serving tray (it&#39;s reversible!) I have ever seen with 6 or 7 different types of wood in it. It&#39;s made by a small shop called Hardwood Creations that&#39;s located near Sacramento.\n \nThere was also a vendor there that made the most adorable dresses, but they&#39;re only in kiddo sizes. Why do kids get all the cute clothes?! So, I of course had to come straight home and make a similar (but enormous) dress to fit me.\n\nSince I have no boobs, I made the back and front the exact same size and shape, so I can choose each day which way I want to wear it. Maybe I was secretly trying to follow the reversible theme that my new cutting board had spawned.\n\nAnother enticing thing I saw at the festival was a little girl eating a delicious looking ice cream cone. I don&#39;t think downtown Mountain View serves vegan ice cream cones anywhere, so I decided to make my own at home.\n I started with a box of plain cones.\n\nNext, I melted about a third of a bag of chocolate chips.\n\nWhile the chocolate was melting, I gathered up some sprinkles and such. I know it can be difficult to find vegan sprinkles, trust me, I&#39;m constantly on the lookout. Here are a couple of brands that I know of that are vegan, but if you have other suggestions, please comment below. One thing I&#39;ve been looking for forever that I can&#39;t seem to find is vegan star-shaped sprinkles. I have them on my tattoo, but have never had them in real life. If you know where to get them, I might propose marriage.\n\nOnce the chocolate is melted, dip the cone into it.\n\n\nNext, before the chocolate dries, dip the cones into vegan sprinkles (or shredded coconut or cookie crumbs or mini chocolate chips or anything really).\n\n\nThen let them air dry. Or if you&#39;re impatient like me and have been craving an ice cream cone since you saw a little girl eating one hours before, then stick them in the freezer for 10-15 minutes.\n\nOnce the chocolate has hardened, top with ice cream. I&#39;ve been on this kick for the past couple of months where I only want to eat the chocolate salted caramel ice cream from Steve&#39;s, because basically all other ice cream tastes subpar after having that kind.\n\n So, yeah, that&#39;s how the art &amp; wine festival basically wrote the agenda for my entire day.\n        \n\n",

        "content": "\n\n\n          East Bay Excursion\n        \n\n        \n        \n          I’ve been wanting to check out Sanctuary Bistro in Berkeley since they opened a few weeks ago. I finally had a free day, so I planned a few other east bay activities to partake in before din din.\nIt started with a trip to East Bay Depot where I found some Hello Kitty stationary and a lavender tablecloth for only $6!\nSince we were right next to Sacred Wheel, we stopped in to share a grilled cheese, and learned that now they have quite a few vegan items on the menu. They had a gazpacho, which was a nice alternative to the Pabst Blue Ribbon tomato soup that I usually order to dip my grilled cheese in. Another nice change was that instead of daiya, they now make their grilled cheese with a nut-based cheese that’s quite good.\nNext was Artis for their famous vanilla almond milk lattes. They make their own vanilla from vanilla beans, so it’s quite a treat. While I was paying for my latte, I noticed a sign near the register that they carry Genuto -- a locally made gelato that I recently heard about but haven’t tried yet. When I asked the cashier about it, she informed me that they use it to make vegan affogatos! It was too late for me to change my order and much too late in the day to have 2 coffees, so I’ll have to go back for that.\n\nAfter Artis, we hit up the Crate &amp; Barrel Outlet Store on the same block where I got 6 cute new dishes to match the square white set I currently have from there.\nOf course, no trip to Berkeley would be complete without a trip to Republic of V. They didn’t have the new cool whip I was looking for, but I did manage to find these new items that I hadn’t tried before.\n\nThe sea salt chocolate covered caramels were super good! The sausages are a lot different from the field roast breakfast sausages: they&#39;re bigger, they&#39;re saltier, and they taste more like real meat. I think I prefer the field roast ones.\nWhen we first got to Sanctuary Bistro, they somehow didn’t have our reservation, and it took them about 5 minutes of looking concerned and worrying us, before they finally agreed to let us stay. That was kind of annoying, but then when we sat down, they had black napkins in these cute fork napkin rings, so I quickly forgot about the rocky start.\n\n \nFor each thing we ordered, I’ll list a description, paste a picture, and give my opinion on how it was.\nArtisan plate: Flax crackers with cashew chevre, pecan mousse, and citrus tofu, with a side of roasted rosemary figs.\n\nI wasn’t a fan. I don’t know what chevre is supposed to taste like since I haven’t eaten cheese in 15 years, and when I did, it certainly wasn’t anything fancy. This cashew cheese was really bland. The good thing about it was its smoothness, which is usually my challenge when I make cashew cheese. The pecan mousse was too sweet for my liking. The tofu tasted lemony and was better than the nut cheeses (which is soooo weird, because I usually don’t like tofu). I tasted the fig, and it tasted smoked, which I also wasn’t a fan of. Overall, this was a waste of $14 for me.\n\nMacadamia-Miso salad: Romaine lettuce, avocado, Eatwell Farm cherry tomatoes, and tempeh croutons, with a macadamia miso dressing\nI’m sorry I didn’t take a picture of this one, but I was kinda starving at this point. Haha. It just looked like a caesar salad, nothing special. I liked the dressing a lot, but the croutons were NOT croutons. They were soggy, and the flavor wasn’t a nice crouton flavor. It was just pieces of tempeh, but when you’re expecting croutons, it’s a grave disappointment.\n\nCarrot Pâté: Compliments of the chef atop a cucumber slice\n\nThis carrot pâté was really yummy and was my second favorite thing we had. This was given complimentary to all the diners, and probably should be on the menu considering that I liked it more than many of the things we ordered. Also, it was cute to see it served on a cucumber slice, since that was how I served my artichoke pâté that I made a couple of months ago.\n\nCrab-less cakes: Oyster mushroom patties with microgreens and a remoulade sauce\n\nThese were the best thing we ordered. They tasted like they were made with Bulghur Wheat or Kasha. They had oyster mushrooms, as well as a lot of other veggies. I think I liked the tartar sauce the best. It had a ton of dill in it, which made it super delish. I’m probably going to try to make these at home sometime, but mine will be cuter shapes than circles.\n\nRavioli: Filled with mushroom duxelle in a spinach cream sauce, topped with braised carrot and zucchini.\n\nThe flavor of this was good, but the consistency of the ravioli was really weird. It tasted thick and doughy and more like dumplings than ravioli. I’ve been wanting to make my own ravioli, but this was discouraging. It makes me think it’s more difficult than I had imagined, because they most certainly did not nail it.\n\nDecadent Chocolate Parfait: Chocolate mousse with coconut whipped cream, topped with a mini almond butter cup.\n\nI’m not sure that decadent is the right word to describe this. It was good, don’t get me wrong, but I think the chocolate parfait at veggie grill is more decadent than this was. The mousse was quite light and airy, which is hard to do with vegan mousse in my opinion. The coconut whipped cream tasted like it had lemon zest in it, which was unusual. The almond butter cup was tasty, and similar to the ones I make.\n\nIn addition to the fiasco we had with our reservation being “lost” and some of the food being less than desirable, there were other strange happenings that made me feel like this restaurant had a curse put on it or something. Not once, but twice, different servers managed to spill water either on themselves or on the poor women dining at the table next to ours. Also, even though our table was the furthest from the kitchen, the noise of dishes clattering was so loud that at a couple points, I almost plugged my ears. I’m not sure what’s going on with the acoustics in that place, but maybe they should turn up the music to drown out the sounds clanking from the kitchen.\n\nAll in all, I won’t be going back to spend $90 on a subpar dinner. I’d rather spend $30 more and go to Millenium for a fine dining experience that I know I will enjoy, and where I am always treated in very high regard by the staff.\n\n        \n\n",

        "content": "\n\n\n          Vegan Hot Fudge Sundaes\n        \n\n        \n        \n          The last time I made these, I couldn&#39;t share the pictures with the world because the cookie bowls ended up looking like the hunchcookie of vegan dollhouse. They were not attractive. Or as the book Wonder that Isabelle has been reading to me says, &#34;The universe was not kind to those cookie bowls.&#34;\nThis time, I used the knowledge I gained from my disastrous experience, even though it goes completely against all of my personal beliefs. That important life lesson was that less is more.\nLet me backtrack for one sec. I happened to have had a 40% off coupon for Michaels, which is the only reason I own this item that is basically only good for one purpose (although I will make it my mission to use for at least 3 other things so I don’t feel like I’m sacrificing my precious kitchen space for little reason). If you don&#39;t already have this cookie bowl making pan made by Wilton, you can probably drape your cookie dough over the back of a cupcake or muffin pan and get a similar result.\n\nSo, this time, instead of molding the cookie dough all the way to the base of the cookie bowl sheet, I experimented with different levels of &#34;using less&#34; cookie dough.\n\nEven though I tried to be so modest with the cookie dough, some of them still ended up a bit monstrous (I&#39;m looking at you, cookie bowl in the lower right corner).\n\nI also think that next time, I might try using the cookie recipe without the mini chocolate chips, and pressing the chips into just the sides since my cookie bowls tended to want to act like little rocking chairs (rocking bowls?) once they were filled and asked to sit still and be good.\nThis is an extremely important part of making ice cream sundaes...always use Steve&#39;s Ice Cream. I&#39;m so serious! I cannot stress this enough. If you&#39;re vegan, and you like ice cream, please try this. It is the bomb! And I don&#39;t even say that...like ever. But this ice cream makes me want to use words I never use. It&#39;s that hella good.\n\nThe part you can&#39;t actually see in the pictures is the hot fudge I use. I know you can make your hot fudge yourself, but there just aren&#39;t enough hours in every day for me to make everything from scratch. Also, when I make my own, it doesn&#39;t come in this jar with the adorable melted chocolate wax lid.\n\nI make my own whipped cream out of coconut cream, because I think all the vegan whipped creams on the market currently suck, but I’m sooooo excited about So Delicious coming out with cool whip next month. If you ever need to make whipped cream, there’s a recipe here.\n\nThe maraschino cherries from Tillen Farms are AMAZING! I usually don&#39;t buy them because who the hell knows what is in most of them, but these ones from Tillen are clean, natural, and taste soooo good.\n\n        \n\n",

        "content": "\n\n\n          Vegan Bubble Gum\n        \n\n        \n        \n          I recently learned that my eldest was stopping at a store on his way home from school, buying a pack of gum, and basically chewing the entire thing while doing homework before I even arrive home from work. I read the ingredients on the pack of gum, and I was appalled. I&#39;ve spent this kid&#39;s entire life feeding him all organic, vegan food, and not even buying him toothpaste that has toxic ingredients, only to find out that he will apparently put ANYTHING into his body without even batting one of his long lush gorgeous eyelashes (he definitely didn&#39;t get those from me!).\nSoooo...I went online and looked for some all-natural gum. There are surprisingly quite a few that I would approve of, but there was one that stood out to me as being the most cute and fun one. It&#39;s difficult to get someone to break a habit unless there&#39;s an incentive, right? So, in this case, I discovered there are quite a few incentives!\nTreeHugger bubble gum comes in a lot of fun flavors: Pomegranate, Lemonade, Wildberry, Watermelon, and Tangerine, just to name a few. We did a few tests of the gum, and below are the results of these tests.\n \n\n\n\n\nTest 1: Flavor\nThe youngest reports, &#34;I like this gum. We should get this gum all the time.&#34;\nThe eldest reports, &#34;The complex flavor profile blends well to make a delectable gum.&#34; What he seemed to like the most about the TreeHugger bubble gum is that the flavors weren&#39;t simple. He feels like most bubble gum has very simple flavors and just a lot of sugar.\nI liked the flavors too. They start to wear off after about 10 minutes, but there&#39;s still a slight hint of flavor that remains.\n \nTest 2: Bubble blowing\nThe gumballs come in the 2 sizes that we are accustom to gumballs being: small and large. We were able to blow small bubbles with around 3-4 of the small gumballs, but had to chew around 5-6 to get the large sized bubbles you see here.\n\n \nTest 3: Nutritional value\nThis is my favorite part! These are made with only natural colors, but they still look so pretty!\n\nThere are no artificial flavors or ingredients that I can&#39;t pronounce. It&#39;s also gluten-free, which I&#39;m sure is a plus for a lot of families (but doesn&#39;t really apply to ours). I hope one of the stores in SF sells the individually wrapped large gumballs so I can pass them out on Halloween. I&#39;m soooo excited for Halloween!!!\nVisit TreeHugger online: they have a super cute website, and you can find out where to buy it.\n\n        \n\n",

        "content": "\n\n\n          Birthday gift idea\n        \n\n        \n        \n          Sometimes birthdays sneak up on you, and you don&#39;t have time to go shopping for the perfect present. Sometimes google shopping express doesn&#39;t have the perfect present (*gasp*). Sometimes Amazon Prime doesn&#39;t ship fast enough for last minute birthdays...not that the birthday was last minute...the birthday is always on the same day every year...I&#39;m not trying to blame the birthday for my inability to plan ahead here. This post is the solution to this exact problem...if the birthday girl in question happens to like quirky, yet well-appreciated and stylish gifts (thank you Erik&#39;s copywriting skills).\nHere&#39;s how to do it. \nStep 1. Find a jar. I just ate the last few olives that were in an olive jar in my fridge. Sometimes, people have cute mason jars lying around, but any old jar will do. Remove the label if there is one. Clean the jar and dry it really well. \n \nStep 2. Make a new label for the jar. I made mine on the computer and printed it on label paper, but you can just draw on label paper or print one on regular paper and tape or glue it on. You don&#39;t even really need a label. This is basically optional.\n \nStep 3. Write or type out the instructions to accompany the muffin mix. My instructions said this, but if you already know that your recipient has a muffin pan (bigger cubbies than cupcake pans), you can cusomtize the cooking time to 30-35 minutes for muffin-sized pans.\n\n \nStep 4. Cut out a circle of fabric slightly larger than your lid, punch a hole in your instruction card, and cut a piece of ribbon long enough to wrap around the lid and tie in a bow.\n \nStep 5. Make the muffin mix in two separate bowls.\nBowl #1: Sift together 2 cups organic unbleached flour, 1.5 tablespoons baking powder, and a half teaspoon of salt.\nBowl #2: Sift together 3/4 cup sucanat or coconut sugar, 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour, 1/2 tablespoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon ginger, and 1/4 teaspoon cloves.\n\n\nStep 6. Layer the two mixes into the jar. Add chocolate chips at the top. These muffins taste great with a half bag of chocolate chips, but if you can fit more into your jar, then the muffins will probably taste even better!\n\n\n\nStep 7. Optional: Bundle the muffin mix with the other necessary ingredients so that the birthday girl has everything needed to make them.\n\n        \n\n",

        "content": "\n\n\n          Wisdom Tooth Weekend\n        \n\n        \n        \n          ♫ Listening to: Wisdom Tooth Weekend by Sicko ♫\n\nYou, like me (and probably 99% of the U.S. population), probably got your wisdom teeth taken out when you were around 18 years old. My boyfriend grew up in Spain, and apparently in Spain, they live by a motto that&#39;s something similar to &#34;if it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it.&#34; Or maybe I&#39;m thinking of the south. Regardless, he got his wisdom teeth taken out today at the abnormal age of 34.\nThere are all these rules about what he&#39;s allowed to eat when, so I thought I might as well document it for any other vegans who have to undergo this experience and are in need of a cheat sheet.\nDay 1\nRight after the extraction, you&#39;re not allowed to eat anything for about 4 hours. You can&#39;t even really drink water because your mouth is stuffed with gauze and you look like a chipmunk.\n\nOnce the anesthesia wears off, you should start taking your medications that your dentist prescribed with ice water. In day one, cold drinks are the best thing for you. You shouldn&#39;t have anything hot or even warm.\nAfter a glass of ice water and a pain pill, the bleeding should be almost stopped. At this point, if you don&#39;t want to look like the cute little chipmunk that you are, you can wrap an ice pack in a kitchen towel, and hold it onto your cheeks for 20 minutes on and 20 minutes off to help bring down the swelling.\nMeal #1: Chocolate Peanut Butter Milkshake\n\n2 frozen bananas\n2 tablespoons cocoa powder\n3 tablespoons peanut butter\n½ teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 scoop chocolate protein powder (I use Vega)\n¾ cup soymilk\n\nDirections:\nBlend the ingredients together until there are no more chunks of banana.\nSnack #1: Guacamole\nI didn&#39;t make this from scratch, but you can. I bought organic guacamole from Costco a few days before the surgery. Instead of having it with chips, you just eat bites of it from a spoon. Yum!\nMeal #2: Tomato Soup\n\n1 can organic tomato sauce\n1 can unsweetened nondairy milk\n⅛ teaspoon onion powder\n⅛ teaspoon garlic powder\n⅛ teaspoon pepper\n½ teaspoon salt\n\n\nTomato Soup directions:\nWhisk the ingredients together. If the milk came out the fridge, you should heat it on low until it&#39;s room temperature.\n\nMeal #3: Chocolate Pudding\n\n½ cup organic sugar\n⅓ cup cocoa powder\n¼ cup organic cornstarch\n¼ teaspoon salt\n3 cups organic soymilk\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\nChocolate Pudding directions:\nWhisk the dry ingredients together.\nAdd the milk slowly while whisking until it&#39;s completely mixed.\nHeat in a medium saucepan over medium heat, whisking every minute or two.\nWhisk continuously for 2-3 minutes as soon as it starts to bubble and thicken.\nRemove from heat, pour into glasses, and chill all day or overnight in the fridge.\n\n \nDay 2\nMeal #1: Yogurt\nThank you Wholesoy for making yogurt again, because trying to come up with this many soupy food ideas on my own is difficult, and quite honestly, I hate the taste of every other vegan yogurt sold in this country. Make sure you don&#39;t eat berry-flavored yogurt, because any tiny seeds could get caught in the gaping holes where your teeth used to be.\nMeal #2: Organic Tomato Juice\nI haven&#39;t been listing all the drinks here, but we&#39;ve been having ice water, cold juice, and chilled coconut water between meals. The reason I&#39;m listing this one as a meal is because tomato juice is so thick and filling, that I think it sort of counts as a meal.\n\nSnack #1: Cold Brew Coffee\nThis is the first time you&#39;re allowed to have coffee. Yay! After the surgery, you have to wait 24 hours before consuming alcohol or caffeine. Since all beverages you consume are supposed to be cold, today we&#39;re having our coffee in the form of cold brew. If you aren&#39;t familiar with cold brew, it&#39;s a healthier way to consume coffee, has a milder taste, and has more caffeine. Since the caffeine content is higher, you don&#39;t want to drink a glass of it. It&#39;s concentrated! I usually mix mine with vanilla coconut coffee creamer and soymilk.\n\n\nYou probably think the one with the whipped cream on top is for the one recovering from oral surgery, but you&#39;d be wrong. That one is for meeeeeee.\nMeal #3: Jello\nThere are many different varieties of packaged vegan jello on the market, some of them better than others. Jello is so easy to make whether you have a package or are just using juice and agar agar. This one sets really well, but it uses xylitol as the sweetener, which I&#39;m not a big fan of, so I probably won&#39;t buy it again.\n\n\nMeal #4: Carrot Ginger Miso Soup\nSauté a diced onion, 4 cloves of diced garlic, and 2 pounds of thinly sliced carrots in a few tablespoons of olive oil. Once the onion is translucent, add enough water to cover the carrots, a heaping tablespoon of miso, and some bouillon. Cook on low for a few hours and then use an immersion blender to pureé it enough for the recovering patient to be able to eat it. If you don&#39;t have a handheld blender, you can use a regular blender, but you&#39;ll have to blend it in a few batches. Make sure you let it cool a lot before the wisdom-toothless consumes it.\n\nDessert: Chocolate Salted Caramel Ice Cream by Steve&#39;s\n \nDay 3\nThis is the first day you can actually start having real food. They have to be soft foods though.\nMeal #1: Tofu Scramble\nMake a really basic scramble. Mince the onions in a food processor before sautéing them to make sure your patient won&#39;t have difficulty trying to chew anything too big.\nMeal #2: Raw Tiramisu\nI made up a recipe loosely based on the live love eat raw recipe. It has a lot of nuts in it, so it&#39;s filling, but soft enough to eat on day 3.\n\nMeal #3: Mashed potatoes and carrots\nSorry I didn&#39;t get any pictures of this, but it was just the same as making mashed potatoes, but I boiled carrots with the potatoes to make it more healthy. On day 3, pretty much anything mashed is okay. I even left the skins on the potatoes, and he had no difficulty eating it.\n \nDay 4\nMeal #1: Fried apples\nMy stepmom brought over some apples, but since apples are too crunchy, I decided to soften them by cooking them. I just cut about 4 apples into cubes and put them in a saucepan with about a half cup water. I sprinkled a teaspoon of cinnamon over them and cooked them on low-medium until the water was gone.\nMeal #2: Hummus\nCrackers, chips, and raw veggies are too crunchy, so hummus by the spoonful is the best way to consume it right now. If you don&#39;t have time to plan out your wisdom tooth shopping in advance, then you can make your own hummus fairly easily at home if you have a blender or food processor. Just use chickpeas, tahini, lemon juice (I didn&#39;t have any lemons, so I used lime juice and it was fine), and garlic salt (or salt + garlic powder).\n\nMeal #3: Starfishy cakes\nThese are made with kasha and roasted red peppers. At this point, the wisdom toothless can basically eat anything that&#39;s not too crunchy. All cooked grains, pastas, beans, and veggies should be fine. Just stay clear from chips, raw veggies, crackers, and basically anything crispy, crunchy, or that requires a lot of chewing for the next week or two.\n\n \nDon&#39;t forget to put your teeth under your pillow for the tooth fairy, unless your dentist is selfish and keeps your teeth for himself, like David&#39;s dentist did.\n        \n\n",

I have a coffee addiction. A big one. I limit myself to drinking coffee twice a day, but in actuality, I want to drink it all day long. The second I finish drinking it, I wish there was more, and the only reason I eat lunch is so that I can earn my second cup of coffee.\nThe first time I ever had cold brew was at cafe gratitude about 10 years ago. They explained the process to me as being a healthier way to consume coffee that required no heat (except for in the roasting of the coffee beans of course). My favorite thing to order from cafe gratitude since then has been their coffee milkshake made with cold brew.\nThen, a couple of years ago, I started seeing cold brew being sold in bottles at stores. My friend Eidelyn got me some Stumptown cold brew for my birthday a couple of years ago, and I&#39;ve been hooked ever since. Buying cold brew is rather pricey (around $10 a bottle), so making your own is a good compromise (because obviously living your life without it is NOT an option).\nIt&#39;s super easy to make, and the great thing is that you can use coffee that isn&#39;t as high of quality and it still comes out tasting really good. Blue Bottle coffee in San Francisco uses peaberry beans to make their iced coffee. Apparently the peaberry bean is kind of known for making good iced coffee, so I use it for my cold brew.\n\nI&#39;ve noticed that everyone makes theirs a little differently, so my way is just one of many.\nThe first thing of importance is to grind the beans to a medium-coarse grind. I use a burr grinder so I usually set it to 3.5, which is about the same coarseness I use when grinding for french press coffee. The amount of beans depends on how much cold brew you want to make. I try to use a ratio of 1:6, with 1 part coffee grounds and 6 parts cold water. My french press happens to be the larger one, so it can hold 1 cup of grounds and 6 cups of water.\n\nWithout a french press, you can just make this in a jar or a bowl. It doesn&#39;t really matter where you soak the coffee as long you remember to stir it every few hours. When you add the water, make sure it&#39;s room temperature or colder. And then give it a good stir so that all the ground become wet.\n\nI usually brew mine for about 12 hours. Some people only brew it for 8 hours. You can experiment and see how mild or flavorful you like yours.\nTo strain it, you can either use a french press or just pour it through a filter on a chemex or a coffee dripper. I&#39;ve been so hard up for coffee before that one day when I left my chemex at work, I rested a funnel in the top of a glass pitcher. Get creative with whatever you have lying around.\nYou can drink the cold brew as is over ice.\n\nOr if you&#39;re like me and you like your coffee to taste like coffee flavored ice cream, you can add coconut creamer...\n\n...and soymilk.\n\nThen, if you&#39;re a fat ass vegan glutton like me, you can add coconut whipped cream to the top of yours.\n\n        \n\n",

        "content": "\n\n\n          Happy Birthday Millennium!\n        \n\n        \n        \n          Millennium is by far the best vegan restaurant in northern California, so needless to say, I dine there us much as possible. I&#39;ve been to quite a few events that they have including the southern comfort annual dinner and the winemaker&#39;s events. Tonight&#39;s event was nothing like those, but I ended up being pleasantly surprised.\nMost of the tables were cleared out and instead of being seated upon arrival, we were greeted with a glass of prosecco and noticed that everyone was walking or standing around mingling. Food was being both passed around as well as offered on buffet tables for you to help yourself. It was more like attending a cocktail party than dining out.\n\nThere was a band playing in the corner, and I think I would categorize the style of music as bluegrass.\n\nI didn&#39;t take pictures of all the food, and I will apologize in advance for the horrible quality of the pictures, but there&#39;s a reason why I&#39;ve never done a blog post on my meals at Millenium before. The lighting in there is romantic and not conducive to food photography.\nThe crusted trumpet mushrooms are my favorite appetizer on their menu, and I order them EVERY single time I go.\n\nThere were 3 kinds of pâté: red pepper, pecan-mushroom, and chard.\n\nSurprisingly, the chard pâté tasted the best, even though it looked the worst.\n\nThere were toppings for bruschetta which included an eggplant one, a white bean and fennel one, and an olive one. \n\nThe olive one was the best.\n\nSome of the items being passed were their famous BBQ glazed tempeh, spicy tofu, marinated mushrooms, gazpacho, and black bean torte. Look how cute the black bean tortes are!\n\nThere were two other notably cute items. One was similar to a summer pizza.\n\nHere&#39;s a closeup.\n\nAnd the other was a slice of watermelon radish with a cashew cheese on top.\n\nThere were also two kinds of salads which I didn&#39;t partake in because I was getting really full. One was lentil and the other was quinoa. But I did manage to make room for half of a butternut squash pekora.\n\nThen for dessert, there were mini cupcakes that tasted like piña colada, their famous midnight chocolate pie (sorry no picture this time, but since I order this every time I go, I can dig up a picture from my archives if need), and a lemon bar.\n\n\nThe highlight of the night just so happened to fall during dessert time...a cream puff! The pastry part of the cream puff tasted right on, but unfortunately, the cream part still didn&#39;t taste like a traditional cream puff. It was the closest vegan eclair/cream puff filling I have had so far, but it tasted too much like cashews unfortunately.\n\n        \n\n",

        "content": "\n\n\n          Vegan Food/drink Garnishes\n        \n\n        \n        \n          As much as I love everything cute, I tend to shy away from cute things that I think that are made with toxic on non-vegan ingredients. This is an extremely difficult thing to do, because there are so many adorable kawaii things that aren&#39;t vegan or have chemicals in them.\nUntil I discovered Tillen Farms, I would have rather had an ice cream sundae with no cherry than use one of those super cute, yet confidently bad for me maraschino cherries. Luckily, now, I don&#39;t have to choose to live without something awesome.\nTillen Farms makes a wide variety of food and drink garnishes that are all vegan. I predict they are marketing towards the fancy cocktail market, but there is such a nice variety of cherries that can garnish a wide variety of food items that I needed to make the world aware of these! I can see some amazing black forest cakes and milkshakes with whipped cream and cherries in the vegan future.\nThe cherries come in 4 colors/flavors.\n\nThe tickled pink are definitely the cutest! You would never guess that these are all-natural, but they are! My next favorite are the merry maraschino. These are a nice bright red. Bada bing are the traditional dark red bing cherry color that we&#39;ve come to love, and the rainier reserve are made from rainier cherries, so they have that same coloring.\nIn these 2 sundaes pictured here, the tickled pink is on the left and the bada bing is on the right.\n\nIsabelle, who normally hates maraschino cherries, actually liked these! I was making cute little mocktails for Zen and Isabelle with fresh ginger juice, some of the juice from the cherries jar, and the cherries, and they LOVED them!\nThen we decided to try out the other garnishes that Tillen Farms makes.\n\nDavid made us bloody marys using the recipe from the Pure Vegan cookbook. You probably don&#39;t need a recipe if you buy your own veganshire sauce, but this book gives you the recipe for that as well.\n\n(Photo credit: David Calavera)\nAnother cool factoid about Tillen Farms is that their products are all made in a nut-free environment, so these would be perfect for those who have severe nut allergies. They&#39;re also kosher and gluten-free in addition to being vegan! It&#39;s so nice to find a product that accommodates so many varieties of dietary restrictions. You can find their products at Whole Foods (at least you can at my Whole Foods), but you can also order directly from their website.\n        \n\n",

        "content": "\n\n\n          Blind Tiger dining\n        \n\n        \n        \n          Finally! I have been wanting to try S+M Vegan for months now (since I first heard of them), and I finally got lucky enough to try it. I can&#39;t recall how I first heard of them early this year, but I think I joined a meetup group in hopes of either attending or hosting one of their elusive pop-up dinners. After realizing that their meetup group was relatively inactive, I saw them listed as a vendor at the east bay vegan beer fest. So, even though I was packing to move that weekend, I drove to the east bay just to partake in this infamous reuben. Sadly, the event was so crowded and the lines were so long, that I had to depart before being given the opportunity to try some of their delectable fare.\nSoon after, Republic of V tagged S+Mvegan on instagram to show off their sandwiches they started carrying. So I started following them in hopes of maybe having better luck with my stalking (ahem), I mean finding out about their events before they&#39;re over. And it worked!* \nJust days before David&#39;s birthday, they posted that they had 3 tickets left to the blind tiger dinner which was taking place a couple of days from then. Since the location was a secret when I purchased the tickets, I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s the &#34;blind&#34; part of the blind tiger dinner. This couldn&#39;t have been more perfect since I had not yet thought of a birthday present for David.\nOn the day of the event, the location was announced, and I left early to make sure there wasn&#39;t some auto-induced death or sportsball game causing a traffic delay—nothing would keep me from finally tasting this mysterious cuisine! Since traffic seemed to be in my favor, I had time to stop at Republic of V to pick up Miyoko&#39;s new cheese, which is delicious, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has yet to partake.\nThe location of the event was in a warehouse/art studio/office building of sorts with a skylight and ideal lighting, so lucky for you, these pictures look 3465936 times better than any I have ever taken at Millennium.\nWhile waiting for the remaining 18 diners to arrive, we talked with Dan, who owns Bison Brewery. We learned all about his brewing techniques, how few certified organic breweries there actually are in the United States, and how his partnership in the blind tiger dinners is such an integral part of the event. I&#39;m not much of a beer drinker, so I didn&#39;t actually benefit from this, but there were beer pairings with 5 of the 6 courses at dinner, including a Red Reuben beer with the reuben course and a chocolate stout with dessert. We also learned that much of the food we ate during the dinner was cooked using the bison beer. So, apparently I do like beer afterall...it just has to be prepared by Shane and Marie in the form of exquisite noms.\nCourse 1: Tacos\nThere were 3 kinds of tacos: Red chili pepper stuffed with cashew cheese, trumpet mushroom, and eggplant.\n\n\nCourse 2: Salad with tapenade shards!\nIn case you missed that, I said tapenade shards! This is complete and utter brilliance! They looked so cute sticking out of the salad, like thin purple crackers, but more importantly, if you think you like olive tapenade, you will LOVE these! The salad also had green zebra tomatoes, early girl tomatoes, and massive croutons (that I couldn&#39;t eat in one bite) from Morrell&#39;s Bread. I get the feeling that S+Mvegan gets all their ingredients from local sources.\n\nCourse 3: Smoked popcorn\nThis was smoked popcorn, on top of a teeny tiny potato (the size of a grape) stuffed with potato and shiro miso on top of a shiso leaf. I was glad this course was tiny because even without drinking beer, I was already starting to feel like I might not make it through 6 courses. And I love all the shades of purple in this dish!\n\nCourse 4: Polenta\nThis ragu dish had polenta, mushrooms, almonds, and tongue of fire beans. The crazy thing is that when Shane was introducing the dish and mentioned the tongue of fire beans, I thought it was something new I had never heard of. But once I googled it, I see that they are the beans I&#39;ve been buying at farmer&#39;s market that are being referred to cranberry beans. Needless to say, it was delicious. I had seconds even though I was getting full.\n\nCourse 5: Build-your-own-reuben slate\nThis was the best thing everrrrrrrrrrr. Not just because I had been waiting to try their reuben since vegan beer fest, but because this seitan could easily be the best seitan I have ever tasted. In life. Seriously. I guess it was marinated in the red reuben beer that was paired with this course. Shane said he slices it by hand. It was the perfect thickness...like 0.5 mm. Ha! Not really, but I hate how every packaged seitan at stores is so thick! Who wants that? I&#39;m pretty sure nobody wants that, but vegans are too nice to be fussy. So, on behalf of all vegans everywhere, please seitan makers, slice it thinner. I also learned that Shane and Marie might be willing to be talked into selling their seitan in quantities of 5 pounds or more, so if anyone wants to share some seitan with me, you know where to find me (sitting in the vegan dollhouse kitchen with piles of seitan in my lap, hands, and mouth). I also loved how this dish was served on a piece of slate. The presentation of the entire meal was so pretty! And those cured beets were so delicious! The butter next to the bread was handmade using maize! Okay, I could go on and on about this course alone, but I will stop now. For you.\n\nCourse 6: Dessert\nI almost didn&#39;t think I would have room for dessert, but then I remembered that I&#39;m me...which means my dessert stomach is a completely different one, and there is infinite room in it.\nI&#39;ve never made creme brûlée before, because it doesn&#39;t contain chocolate, so I figured, what&#39;s the point. But now that I&#39;ve tasted it, I understand the point. Finally my neglected torch will be coming out of the cupboard. This one was made with almond milk and corn, which was a nice reprieve from the typical coconut everything I tend to make.\n\nI didn&#39;t take any pictures of the way everything was laid out, but basically everyone sat at a long table with the dishes (with the exception of dessert) being served family style. I even made a friend who sat next to me, taught me about all kinds of new things, and we even have plans to decorate vegan cakes together in the near future!\nThese blind tiger dinners apparently take place the last Sunday of every month, so if you are interested in checking one out, visit the S+M Vegan website to learn more.\n \n* Disclaimer: I&#39;m not promoting stalking as a way to get what you want in all situations...just those involving vegan food.\n        \n\n",

        "content": "\n\n\n          Vegan Products for 2015\n        \n\n        \n        \n          Ohhhh Natural Products Expo West, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways...\n\nI guess this Sweet Earth vegan bacon has been out for awhile, but I&#39;ve never seen it at my Whole Foods, and I very rarely go to Target (which is apparently the one store that carries all of their products). At the expo booth, they were serving virgin bloody marys with this bacon as the garnish, so I will of course be doing this at home soon. It&#39;s really yummy, and it doesn&#39;t have a consistency similar to bacon at all, which is what I love about it. It reminds me of the Morning Star bacon I used to buy before I went vegan. So good! I wish it were organic, but otherwise, the ingredients are pretty healthy. I only wish that Sweet Earth was an all-vegan company. I hate label reading.\n\nBeyong Meat for sure had the most clever booth with their mock McDonalds. I don&#39;t know who&#39;s in charge of their marketing over there, but I&#39;d like to meet them! Brilliant! They even gave out cute little happy meal toys to those waiting in line.\n\n\nThey gave out a little hamburger and some chicken sticks. The hamburger tasted way too real for my liking, but I heard some omnivores talking about how it was good but didn&#39;t taste authentic enough. Shows what I know! The breading on the chicken tenders was thicker than the ones on gardein chicken nuggets (maybe because it was gluten-free?) so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of those either. I guess I just love plain chicken strips from this company (so I can bread them and fry them myself at home).\n\nI&#39;ve been a fan of calafia since they first came onto the market with their almond milk. Then my interest waned when the consistency of their milk changed to be thicker than I prefer. But then they came out with their almond milk creamers which I love! I nowwwwww this!!!! Triple shot cold brew bottled coffees!!! I cannot wait for these! I haven&#39;t had a bottled vegan ready-to-drink coffee beverage that I&#39;ve liked until now. The mexican mocha flavor was sooooooo gooooood.\n\n\n\nI&#39;ve been on the hunt for natural vegan food dyes for basically ever (good, bright ones...not those stupid India Tree ones that just make everything look like different shades of brown). I saw this company in Republic of V awhile back, and when I went back to buy it, they didn&#39;t carry it anymore. So, you can imagine how excited I was to see the Color Garden booth! They even had cookies and a cake that they had decorated using the coloring so you could see what it actually looks like. I got a sample that I be testing out soon and reviewing on here hopefully. So excited!\n\nDaiya is coming out with 3 flavors of mac n cheese. The 2 cheddar flavors aren&#39;t good. But, this alfredo flavor is delicious enough for all 3 of them!\n\n\nThe new Supreme Pizza was my favorite of the 3 new pizza flavors. They formed a partnership with beyond meat to make a sausage pizza that seriously reminds me so much of the Zpizza vegan pizza with the topping they call veggie burger crumbles.\n\n\n\nI was already prepared for what these Daiya cheesecakes would taste like because I&#39;ve made a cheesecake using Daiya creamcheese by following the recipe on their website. I&#39;m not a fan. It just doesn&#39;t taste the kind I&#39;m used to because they&#39;re no-bake cheesecakes. I like the baked ones. However, the amount of cacao in this chocolate flavored one was just enough bitterness to counterbalance the flavor of the daiya creamcheese that I don&#39;t care for, so I actually thought the chocolate cheesecake was good. I didn&#39;t taste the key lime one, but I heard it was good as well, which makes sense because lime is an overpowering flavor as well.\n\n\nThe Follow Your Heart booth was so adorable!\n\nThese new cheeses they came out with are super yummy! They&#39;re way better than the other follow your heart cheeses, and definitely on par with Chao Cheese.\n\nLook how cute these little baby lunch box size ones are!!!!!\n\nI&#39;m a weird picky-pants when it comes to mock seafood, so I didn&#39;t think I would like these Gardein crab cakes, but I was wrong. Very wrong. And the guys at the Gardein booth were super nice and helpful and told me about the restaurant we ended up having dinner at that night since I had never been there before. If you haven&#39;t been to Healthy Junk in Anaheim, I highly recommend it!\n\nAgain, Gardein impressed me with their fish sticks. Although, I did hear some others saying that when they bake them according to instructions on the package, they never taste as good. I guess I just need a Gardein employee to come home with me and feed me.\n\nI know we all love Justin&#39;s PB cups, so of course, a cuter mini version of them made me fall even harder in love.\n\nI took this picture for Kimmy because she love love loves these crackers!\n\n\nAnother vegan food color company?! Yessssss! This one is made by Glob, which I recognized because they make all-natural fingerpaint for kids. I was lucky enough to get a sample of this as well, so when I test out the Color Garden colors, I&#39;ll be testing this as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can tell by the million pictures, Owl&#39;s Brew won the award for cutest booth. I fell in love. They were also serving craft cocktails, so that could have helped. They told me I could find these at BevMo, so I went to BevMo a few days later looking for them, but they said they were discontinued. *sadface*\n\nI&#39;ve been paying a lot of attention to nail polish lately because I really like painting my nails, but I don&#39;t like all the chemicals. Pacifica is a brand that claims to be free of 7 of the toxins that are commonly found in nail polish. I&#39;m hoping to review them soon, but if you&#39;d like to see a list of polishes that are vegan, check out my newest blog post.\n\nScotch Naturals is another company that is free of 7 of the toxins. They said they just reformulated their product to make it better, and I smelled it, and it actually did smell odorless! I haven&#39;t tried this yet, but I&#39;m hoping to do a review soon.\n\nI really like the cinnamon flavor the best. Not a fan of the pomegranate.\n\nRebel Kitchen won the award for the coolest booth. Seriously?! The white brick wall with the cutest-ever black graphic. They make these coconut milk drinks. I liked the chocolate one. I hesitate to compare it to Yoohoo, because who the hell knows what used to be in that stuff, but it was slightly reminiscent. Now everyone knows how old I am. Secret&#39;s out.\n\n\nThese dinners were yummy, but the chick who worked the booth either hated me or hated her life. She was not nice at all. When I asked her why they didn&#39;t use organic noodles (they used all organic ingredients except for the noodles), she rudely informed me that there&#39;s no such thing as organic rice noodles. I didn&#39;t argue with her. I just moved on.\n\nSteve&#39;s!!!!! I was so happy that they were there. I&#39;m seriously a psycho fan of this stuff. I&#39;ve been a regular consumer of the chocolate salted caramel ice cream ever since Sprouts started carrying it. I tried to visit their warehouse when I was in New York. (Psycho fan status)\nI also love the trader joes speculoos cookies, so you can imagine my glee when I saw this at their booth! I almost couldn&#39;t contain my excitement, so instead of exploding, I politely (read: psychoticly) informed the booth attendent that I basically already invented this flavor when I made ice cream cookie sandwiches on national ice cream sandwich day with the speculoos cookies and Steve&#39;s cinnamon cold brew coffee ice cream. They didn&#39;t have security escort me out, so either I did a good job acting normal or they were just very, very nice.\n\n\n\nTofurky was sampling a couple of things. The one I didn&#39;t care for was the chick&#39;n salad, which is why there&#39;s no picture of it.\n\nHowever, this tandoori chick&#39;n was crazy good! And I don&#39;t even usually care for Indian food, so they did a great job with this one!\n\n\nTruJoy vegan starbursts were at the Surf Sweets booth. Are they the same company? They must be. Not everything they have is vegan, but they do have vegan starburst and vegan tootsie rolls!\n\nI&#39;ve had this cheese before in London, but so much time had passed that I had forgotten what it tasted like. It&#39;s quite similar to the Chao and the new Follow Your Heart cheese. Some vegan food blogger speculate that all three companies are partnering with the same manufacturer in Europe which is why they&#39;re all so similar.\n\nI think Kimmy told me about this before, but these white sauces are seriously mouth-watering.\n        \n\n",

This goes back to when I used to DJ at college radio stations, and it would make me happy to see my fingernails when I was running the board. Now it translates to seeing my fingers on the keyboard at work. It just makes me happier.\nWhen I found out that not all nail polish was vegan, I looked online for a comprehensive list.

        "title": "Make Your Own Purple Sofa",
        "content": "\n\n\n          Make Your Own Purple Sofa\n        \n\n        \n        \n          I&#39;ve wanted a purple couch for like ever. I see them now and then (about as often as I see purple cars) and admire them from afar. Since I tend not to spend much money on things that aren&#39;t edible (not including rent and bills), I don&#39;t usually get the chance to own specialty items (unless I make them myself or my friends gift them to me). Luckily (only because I&#39;m a glass half-full type of person--otherwise, I would consider this quite unlucky), when David and I combined houses, I was basically gifted a very pale grayish-beigish Ikea Kivik sofa. \nWhen we first put it in the living room with my pretty black and green furniture, it must have felt like an outsider. My furniture isn&#39;t the type to make fun of others, but there&#39;s no way David&#39;s couch has been feeling at home here. After many attempts at finding reasonably-priced covers for this sofa, I finally started looking at alternatives.\nSome people paint their couches, which looks really good when it&#39;s done, but I was slightly concerned about the comfort of the sofa afterwards. That&#39;s when I settled on dying it. I&#39;ve ordered dye from Dharma before, and I like their quality, so I contacted them to find out which dyes were vegan. Every color that is a Fiber Reactive Procion Dye is vegan.\nI ordered the following items from Dharma.\n\n4 oz deep purple colored dye\n1 pound soda ash fixer\n5 pounds salt\n\nTotal cost w/ shipping = $25\n\nStep 1\nRemove the cover from your couch. The kivik is easy because it comes in a lot of pieces and they&#39;re all attached to the wooden sofa with velcro. (Sorry I didn&#39;t take a good before picture, but here&#39;s David taking the sofa apart.)\n\nStep 2\nPre-wash the cover. They tell you to use their special soap, but I just used my regular eco-friendly soap that I use for all my laundry. They also say to use hot water, but I was scared that my cover would shrink and not fit back onto the couch, so I used warm. I also have a front loading washing machine which makes it harder than using a top loading machine, but one advantage to the LG front loading machine is that it has a setting for bulky/large loads, so I used that. Since the dye needs to be soaking into the fabric for a certain period of time, the tricky part of dying things in a washing machine is that you have to stop the machine before it goes from the wash cycle to the rinse cycle, so while I was prewashing, I actually sat in my garage in front of the washer and stared at it until it switched from wash to rinse so I would know the exact moment when it would happen. On mine, that moment is between 31 and 29. (I know that wasn&#39;t a completely exact moment, but Jessica was texting me a crazy story about a text she got from one of her co-workers, so how could I not get distracted?!)\nStep 3\nWhen the washer is done, remove the damp covers from the washer and set them on the floor or a table until you&#39;re ready to put them back into the washer. At this point, I refered to some instructions that someone contributed to the Dharma website here, and put my own twist on it.\nStep 4\nOn the stovetop, boil a half of a pot of water using your largest pot. Then slowly add the salt a cup at a time, dissolving each cup thoroughly (I used a whisk) before adding the next cup. I think I used a total of 8 cups of salt. When it was completely dissolved, the water still looked really white, like paint water.\n\nStep 5\nUse a medium sized glass bowl for the dye. Add the dye and then add warm/hot water and stir with a plastic spoon. This is where some people use Urea to help mix the dye so you don&#39;t get tiny dark spots, but urea isn&#39;t vegan, and I am dying dark purple so spots won&#39;t show up like they would if I were dying a pastel color.\n\nStep 6\nStart the washer. After 1-2 minutes, pause the load, and when the door unlocks, open it and pour in the salt water. Then close it and start it again.\nStep 7\nPause the washer after another minute or 2, and open the door once it unlocks. Add the dye mixture. Then start it again. Lay some rags on the floor in front of the washer, because the next time you open it, some dyed water will drip off the door onto the floor.\nStep 8\nAfter another minute or 2, pause, open, and add the fabric. Then start the load again. \nStep 9\nFive minutes before your washer is about to switch to the rinse cycle (or more if you&#39;re concerned about time), mix your soda ash. I did this by using my largest pot (the same one I used for dissolving the salt) and filled it 2/3 to 3/4 full with hot tap water. I then added a cup of soda ash and whisked it until it was completely dissolved and the water turned clear (2-3 minutes).\nStep 10\nPause the washer, turn it off, turn it on, turn the dial to the wash setting you used before (mine was Bulky/Large), and start it. Then every 30-60 seconds, add about 3/4 cup of the soda ash water to the soap compartment. Whenever the soap compartment is empltied again, fill it. Repeat this until you have used up all the soda ash water. It took me the entire length of a wash cycle (about 22 minutes) plus part of a second cycle until it was gone.\n\nStep 11\nRemember: no matter what, before the cycle switches to rinse, pause the washer, turn it off, turn it on, turn the dial to the wash setting you used before (mine was Bulky/Large), and start it. You never want to let it get to the rinse cycle or it will drain all your dye and ruin your life (or maybe just the day).\nStep 12\nYou&#39;ll want to repeat the washing cycle at least twice after the soda ash water is completely incorporated. For darker colors, you can even do it a third time. I&#39;m impatient, so I only restarted twice.\nStep 13\nOnce your fabric has been agitating in the dye and soda ash for a minimum of 30 minutes and a maximum of an hour, let the wash cycle run its complete course. Make sure that when it&#39;s on the rinse cycle, that the water temperature is turned to cold. \nStep 14\nWhen that load is complete, you want to wash it once last time as you would wash any load of laundry with detergent and fabric softener. They say to use hot water, but again, I was scared of shrinking my cover, so I used cold.\nStep 15\nDrying. Ideally, to make sure you don&#39;t shrink your fabric, hanging things out to dry is the best. However, I&#39;m a bit short on places to hang large laundry items, such as sofa covers, so I put mine in the dryer on ultra low. We had some difficulty getting the covers on, so I would suggest using all cold water and not using the dryer to dry them.\n\n\nShared on tutorial tuesdays and wicked awesome wednesday\n        \n\n",

The answer was obvious. Ride a unicorn. And nobody wants to ride a unicorn alone, so I coerced some friends to ride unicorns with me.\nHere we are walking from Pam&#39;s house to the Zeum Museum.\n \nWe thought my dress might be floofy enough to hide everyone behind it, so of course, the theory had to be tested.\n \nIs this the unicorn I get to ride? \n\nI thought I would have to drag them kicking and screaming into this adventure, but there was no kicking, and only some minor yelping (which may have come from me), but I still got to drag them.\n \nUnicorns aren&#39;t really meant to have people riding on them, so we gave them a little break while Jessica perfected her heart-hands.\n \nMia and her unicorn decided to sing a duet.\n \nAren&#39;t Jocelyn and her unicorn so photogenic?\n \nAwwww...Pamela ended up making friends with her unicorn.\n \nMia&#39;s unicorn must have given her superpowers so she was able to ride with no hands and not fall off!\n \n\n\n\n\nJust so you don&#39;t think I&#39;m a speciesist, the carousel had horses too.\n \nThanks to Mel for taking pictures of us on the carousel!\n \nAs if riding unicorns wasn&#39;t enough to make the best birthday ever, but when we got back to Pam&#39;s house, I realized that they surprised me with THE CUTEST tea party in the entire world.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n",

Ashley came early to help me set up, and she made these cute tea sandwiches that represent veganism and love all while hugging field roast and chao cheese. They were inspired by the tea sandwiches we had at Muir&#39;s tea room.\n\nAshley also brought some cute cucumber bunnies (not because she mistakenly bought cucumbers at the store when she meant to buy zucchini; just because she thought it would be a nice addition to the tea party).\n\n\nNext to arrive was Eve, and she brought these adorable ice cream sandwiches made with animal crackers. I don&#39;t know how she managed to keep them from melting on her drive from SF, but if you ever need advice on how to transport a dead body or vital organ, I&#39;m pretty sure she could give you some good advice.\n\nBrandi and Rosie came together, and even though Brandi was extremely busy meeting and greeting (and taking selfies with) our canine visitor Frankie, I managed to pry them away from eachother long enough to get this picture of them.\n\nSince Brandi&#39;s persuasion skills are unmatched, Rosie made 2 cute items on their behalf: one sweet &amp; one savory. I would never have guessed that these were the first chocolates she&#39;s ever made. They were not only raw, but they tasted delicious, AND she made 3 kinds!\n\nShe also brought eggless salad sandwich hearts.\n\nThe last to arrive (even though she lives the closest...haha) was Tina, and because her kitchen was a billion degrees today, the marshmallows in her rice krispie treats decided to stay melted forever, and therefore photography of her item was prohibited. Lucky for us, she decided to model both of the things I made....the fried mac-n-cheese hearts....\n\n...and the star-shaped ice cream sandwiches.\n\nWe had a nice variety of teas that included Chai, Cookie, White Rose, Lavender Lemon Mint, Oolong Peach, and Chocolate Strawberry, which were accompanied by Calafia Farms Almond Milk Creamer.\n\n\nAnd here&#39;s a picture of all the gorgeous vegan ladies that I&#39;m lucky to call friends.\n\n        \n\n",

However, I couldn&#39;t think of a cuter way to serve sangria than from a piggy.\nI started by sketching out some plans.\n\nStep 1: Cut out the top piece (I drew the line first to make sure I didn&#39;t mess up).\n\nStep 2: Scoop out all the melon.\n\nI started to get too sticky to take pictures of steps 3-8, but here are some pictures of the finished piggy.\n\n\nMy final step was to make sangria in the pig. The sangria had a few short steps including cutting cute shapes from some of the melon, blending the rest of the melon to make watermelon juice, and adding vodka and sparkling wine. Cutting the watermelon shapes is an integral part to make sure your sangria is as cute as the piggy that serves it.\n\n\nI also brought my breakfast baskets, but I didn&#39;t take any pictures of those since they&#39;re already on this website.\nAlthough the potluck had around 80 attendees, I only got around to tasting a few items.\n\nJen of whollyvegan made these yummy and cutely garnished deviled potatoes.\n\nRoshi made these super cute Dadar Gulung (coconut pandanus pancake) in a variety of different colors.\n\nI think Jen also made these.\n\nI had a great time, and I&#39;m glad Rosie invited me to this annual potluck she organizes with Jen and RG.

I was in the Hikarie Mall, which is attached to the Shibuya train station. The mall has around 10 floors, and there are 3 coffee shops distributed around. The elevators in the mall have a really cute voice. I think the only other elevator I&#39;ve been in that talked to me was the Twitter building elevators, but this one was cuter because it was in Japanese. The mall also had a juice place which sold a lot of familiar american vegan snacks.\nThe first cafe we tried was on the bottom floor and looked a lot like blue bottle (so much that I&#39;m pretty sure they ripped off their logo, cups, and everything else about them), but they didn&#39;t offer soymilk. The second one was a success, so we never visited the 3rd one. \nThe Theatre Coffee made a really good soy latte with cute latte art, but it was a bit pricey.\n\n \nPure Cafe\nDavid had eaten dinner at Pure Cafe before and wasn&#39;t impressed with their food, so we decided to just order dessert only. It was one of the only places open before 11am, so it one the contest for next destination. The cheesecake was quite good. It used a peanut butter crust, which was unique.\n\nThey also had gluten-free items, which Kimmy would have liked.\n\n \nHanada Rosso\nMacrobiotic Vegan Restaurant\n\n \nBrown Rice Cafe\n100% vegan restaurant and organic when possible. This was mostly temple cuisine.\n\n \nDay 2\nAinsoph. journey\nThis salad parfait was so cute that I&#39;m going to start making these at home. The dressing that came with it was so delicious that if anyone at the restaurant spoke english, I would have tried to buy a bottle to take with me.\n\nDavid ordered some sort of marinara with rice.\n\nI ordered pancakes with ice cream and whipped cream. The ice cream tasted like rum raisin. The garnish included some berries that had a fmailiar taste but didn&#39;t look familiar. The staff spoke very little english here, but the menu was partially in english.\n\nRainbow Bird Rendevous\nThis was one of my favorite restaurants in Japan...quite possibly my very favorite. It&#39;s 100% vegan, GMO-free, and free of refined sugars.\n\nCute ceiling decor\n \nPotato croquette\n\nVeggie burger\n\nThis soft serve was the best one I had during my stay in Japan. Tokyo serves soft serve ice cream with cereal in it. This one had corn flakes. I&#39;ll be trying this at home.\n\n \nDay 3\nHarajuku\nHarajuku has a few people...like one or two.\n\nA lot of the malls in Tokyo had cute floors.\n\nDeus Ex Machina\nMy favorite coffee shop in Tokyo was in Harajuku. It&#39;s called Deus Ex Machina. They have soy lattes and do cute latte art. Kurt thought it looked like lumpy space princess.\n\nA trend I noticed in &#34;hip&#34; coffee shops in Japan were copper piping sinks. I saw this in at least 3 different cafes.\n\nOne of the only times we got stuck eating at a restaurant that wasn&#39;t vegetarian and didn&#39;t have an English menu or any English speaking staff was in Harajuku. We ended up at a place called Oriental Recipe and Cafe that&#39;s around the corner from the Tamagachi store at the end of Takeshita-Dori.\nLuckily, I pasted a bunch of Japanese characters into my journal before the trip so I could point to characters. The restaurant had a vegan salad or this vegan curry. \n\nThey also sold these really cute heart-shaped vegan snacks that we bought and ate later on our train ride to Okunoshima.\n \nGiant Black Cat\nDavid read on twitter that there was a giant black cat in the Shinjuku train station puking out presents, so we obviously had to go to get souvenirs for Josipa. Here&#39;s a flipagram of our visit.\n \nKuumba du Falafel\nI took a suggestion from Kylie and went to Kuumba du Falafel for dinner. There&#39;s just one guy who works there and not much seating, but he spoke some English and was able to make us a falafel plate.\n\n \nDay 4\nIsland Veggie\n\nThis vegetarian restaurant was recommended to me by Eidelyn. I wasn&#39;t going to go because Happy Cow listed it as vegetarian, but she assured me that most things could be made vegan, so we went for breakfast. It was hard to find places open early in Japan because places typically open later and stay open later at night, so I was super excited that Island Veggie was open before 9am.\nI ordered a chocolate peanut butter banana shake.\n\nDavid ordered a ham sandwich and it came with a free coffee. This sandwich was less than 700 yen, making this one of the most affordable options I found in Tokyo. \n\n\nThe decor inside was super cute too. And their bathrooms had the potty showers that we all come home from Japan missing.\n\n \nTokyo Tower\n\nThe Tokyo Tower is only 1 or 2 stops away from Island Veggie, so we decided to check it out. The tower itself wasn&#39;t very interesting. It&#39;s a super tall tower. However, because it was in Tokyo, it had all this other cute stuff, like a One Piece themed cafe and store!\n\n\nI tried to go to the cafe, but they didn&#39;t offer soymilk. The word for soymilk is tonyu, so I basically just got into the habit of walking in everywhere and saying &#34;tonyu?&#34; None of the themed restaurants and cafes I tried to go to offered anything vegan.\n\n Since we got denied at the cafe, there&#39;s a park nearby that we walked around in.\n \n \nLa Petite Pattiserie de Mirayne\nThis vegan bakery was a huge disappointment. Do not waste your time going here. The first time I went, they were closed. The second time I went, they were out of mostly everything. \n\n\nWe got the black pepper crackers and the lemon cookies, and they were 1,000 yen for the tiniest containers! But after going all the way there twice (it was out of the way of everything else), we had to buy something. The pepper crackers had wayyyyy too much pepper. Here&#39;s Jack carrying the bag of overly priced baked goods.\n\n \n Lima\nLima is a health food store with an almost all-vegan cafe. We came here to look for snacks for our trip to Bunny Island, but we ended up staying and eating lunch. I highly recommend this place.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then after eating, we found all these snacks to bring with us to Bunny Island.\n\n \nHangOut\nThis all-vegan bar was so good that we came back twice! San Francisco really needs a vegan bar. The things I loved about this bar were that the food tasted better than bar food in the states (for instance, I ordered an amazing salad both times with watermelon radish and roasted kabocha squash), the employees spoke english, the menu was in English, and the menu had pictures so you knew what to expect.\n\nGyozas\n\nThe Bloody Mary didn&#39;t have a garnish, but at least I was able to order one at night.\n\nThis rainbow salad could easily be the best salad I had in Japan.\n\nSome type of mockmeat\n\n \nRilakkuma Store in Harajuku Kiddyland\n\n\n\n \nDay 5\nT&#39;s Tantan\n\nT&#39;s is located inside the Tokyo train station near the Keiyo street exit.\n\nIt&#39;s super clean and modern inside. They don&#39;t have a bathroom but the bathrooms in the train station are fairly clean. I got in the habit of carrying my own soap and washcloth in my purse since oftentimes the train station bathrooms didn&#39;t have soap or hand dryers.\n\nT&#39;s was probably the most affordable vegan place I found in Tokyo, so I ate here like 5 times. My first time was breakfast. Here&#39;s a video of me periscoping the inside of the restaurant.\nI ordered the shoyu ramen almost every time. It was just so delicious and perfectly filling. If you go for breakfast, you can add a coffee for 100 yen (around $1)!\n\n Across the hall and to the left is a bakery.\n \nBoulangerie La Terre\nThey offer between 2 and 5 sweet and savory vegan options each day. It&#39;s all in Japanese, so you have to be able to communicate with the staff. By the end of my trip, I knew the words for butter, milk, eggs, meat, and fish, but I&#39;ve forgotten them all already.\n\n \n\n \nDay 6\nTokyo Skytree\nAlmost everyday in Japan was sunny and a perfect 70 degrees. However, the day we visited the Tokyo Skytree, it was a foggy day with a bit of rain.\n\nLuckily, the skytree is basically a huge 10 story indoor mall so we stayed warm and dry. The disney stores there are so much cuter than ours. There was a conglomeration between Disney and h. NAOTO to make a Nightmare Before Christmas line. \n\nI really wanted this bat purse, but it&#39;s too small to be practical.\n\nYou probably think that the 4 Rilakkuma stores I&#39;ve already visited were enough. You&#39;re wrong.\n\nWho&#39;s hiding in the bushes?\n\n \nSasaya Cafe\n\nThis was one of my favorite restaurants in Tokyo! They understood english well and had an english menu.\n\nThey had a  good selection of desserts.\n\n\n\n\n \nDay 7\nSol&#39;s Coffee\n\nThese baristas were knowledgeable about SF coffee roasters like blue bottle.\n\nI liked the cute mirror in the bathroom.\n\n \nPokemon Center\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSanrioworld Ginza\n\n\n \nDisney Store\nI like how the Disney store looked like a castle.\n\n\n \nDay 8\n \nTomato was an awesome fabric store located in the Nippori district! It had a ton of cute fabrics, and the best part was that they played poppunk music while I shopped (Milencolin, Pennywise, etc.). Here are some of the cuter fabrics I spotted.\n\n\n \nKomaki Shokudo\nThis place was pretty disappointing. I wouldn&#39;t go back, and I would advise against going. The service was bad. The food was just whatever, except that it was quite expensive.\n\nAfter eating, we tried to visit some themed bars and cafes that were near the restaurant but nobody had soymilk, so we didn&#39;t stay. So, instead I had the fun time of trying to buy stamps and mail postcards and letters. And since you asked, yes, Tokyo does have stamps with Hello Kitty on them!!!\n\n\nWhile at the airport, I made a list of things I would miss about Japan. One thing not listed is how much nicer the airport lounges are in Japan than in america. The food was labeled with allergies so I could determine some things that were vegan, and I made a mimosa.\n\nHere were some of the souvenirs I bought myself in the Ueno district of Tokyo and other random places here and there.\n\n \n \n \n        \n\n",

        "content": "\n\n\n          Bunny Island\n        \n\n        \n        \n          Can you think of the happiest you&#39;ve ever been in your life? Maybe there are a lot of different experiences that come to mind. Mine was a couple of weeks ago on Bunny Island. My life is basically downhill from here, haha.\nI should probably start by admitting that I don&#39;t really go outside. I&#39;m not outdoorsy. I don&#39;t spend my weekend mornings hiking. I don&#39;t camp. It&#39;s just not really my thing. So, it is possible that part of the euphoric experience of Okunoshima for me was just being in nature.\nThe island of Okunoshima itself is gorgeous! Unlike the islands near San Francisco, it wasn&#39;t rocky and super steep. It was relatively flat which made for easy bunny access and a remarkable view of the sunset from the island.\n\nEven just the traveling to the island on the train was beautiful. I loved everything about my visit, and I&#39;m counting the days until I can go back! Next time I&#39;ll stay longer than only one night. I brought a lot of snack to eat on the long train ride including these heart-shaped chips that we picked up in Harajuku.\n\n\nAfter taking a whole bunch of train rides, you arrive at a port where you wait for the ferry. In case you&#39;re unsure of where to wait, there&#39;s a helpful sign.\n\nThe ferry ride to the island makes you feel like you&#39;re in a scene from Jurassic Park.\n\nThe hotel was a traditional Japanese hotel, so at 6pm or so, they come around to your room and lay out your sleeping pads on the japanese mat floors. There&#39;s a toilet and a sink in your room, but the showers are in the public onsen, so if you go, I hope you don&#39;t have an issue with being next to naked people...while you&#39;re naked...and if you&#39;re me, you might have to watch other people shower so that you can learn what to do because you&#39;ve never been in an onsen before. And that&#39;s not awkward at all!\nDon&#39;t worry, I waited until I was alone before taking these pictures of the onsen. Just because I stare at people while they shower doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t know where the line is drawn and when not to cross it (except for those times when I just touch my toe across the line, but that doesn&#39;t count, right?)\n\n\nThe hotel comes with an all-you-can-eat buffet for dinner and breakfast. I just assumed there would be nothing I could eat, so I packed a lot of snacks for the trip. However, to my surprise, the staff were really helpful (and the other tourists too!), so I was able to find quite a lot of vegan food to eat there! I still recommend bringing snacks though, because the hotel doesn&#39;t provide lunch, and the trip to and from the island is a long journey in itself. Here&#39;s a picture of some of the food that was vegan on the breakfast buffet.\n\nThere was also cold tofu, seaweed salad, and other things that I didn&#39;t care for.\nIn addition to bringing snacks for you, you may want to bring snacks for the bunnies. This is a decision each vegan must make for his/herself. The island doesn&#39;t sell food for the purpose of not wanting the bunnies to become reliant on being fed. There are plenty of plants on the island that they can eat, so I think the ideal situation is to let them eat what they are meant to eat. However, I was gifted a bag of grass pellets from a japanese girl, and I fed the bunnies every last pellet. It made them come to me and sit on my lap, and made me the happiest I&#39;ve ever been in life, so when I go back, I will be feeding them. I hope that doesn&#39;t make me a bad vegan.\nI created a youtube channel specifically for videos of Bunny Island, so if you&#39;d like to see bunnies hopping around in their natural habitat, check them out. Oh, and youtube won&#39;t let me change my URL for my channel until I have 100 followers, so please subscribe to my channel while you&#39;re there.\nAnd if you don&#39;t like videos of bunnies (that&#39;s obviously impossible), here are some pictures of the bunnies.\n\n\n\nThere are more remote areas of the island where you can go that have fewer bunnies, but the ones you do find seem to be a little different.\n\nThey chill more, and they don&#39;t run up to you when they see you.\n\nI caught this one giving herself a little bath.\n\nSo, there&#39;s one downside to bunny island. The bunnies are hunted by crows, so some of them have wounds on their ears and faces from the crow attacks. I had the chance to save a baby bunny from being taken by a crow, but then it made me sad to think about what will happen now that I&#39;m not there to save all the bunnies. This one on the left has a missing eye and chunks taken out of his ears.\n\nIf you look in the sky of this picture, you can see the crow flying. When the crows make a noise, the bunnies all run into the woods to hide.\n\n\n\nSome naughty bunny figured out where the food was coming from and decided to cut out the middleman (me).\n\n\n\nIf you&#39;ve ever wondered if bunnies do yoga, here&#39;s your answer.\n\n\n\nThis one looks like she&#39;s smiling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I saved the best for last....the baby bunny!\n\n        \n\n",

Can this country be any cuter?\nNara Park is where the deer hang out. It&#39;s not like they walk down the street and window shop like the rest of the tourists. I think they like the park because there&#39;s a guy selling crackers to humans for the humans to feed the deer. It&#39;s probably not the best thing for the deer to eat, but I bought 2 anyway. I know, I know. Worst Vegan Ever.\nWhen I saw this sign, I started feeling like I didn&#39;t choose the right outfit for this adventure. The deerying (that&#39;s the word for when a deer bullies you) that I experienced wasn&#39;t even listed on the sign, so I guess they didn&#39;t consider it a danger. There was one deer in particular who kept trying to eat the bows off of my dress.\n\n\n\nWhen you run out of deer crackers, they just look at you like they want more. It&#39;s sooooo sad. How could I not buy more?!\n\n\n\nI did a periscope while I was there, and Ashley suggested that I should try to get hugs from the deer. Thanks Ashley!!!\n\nThis one is sticking his tongue out at me. I&#39;m not sure whyyyy....I&#39;m sure it has nothing to do with him being annoyed that I refused to purchase a third bundle of crackers.\n\nAnother cute thing about Nara is that everything in the town seems to be deer themed, from the stairs in the train station to the potholes in the roads.\n\n\nWhen we were walking down the street, I learned that I&#39;ve been kneading dough the wrong way my whole life. Here&#39;s a short video of the way they do it in Japan.\nFor lunch, we found a vegan restaurant called Kinatei.\n\nThe meals were bento style and came with tea or coffee, but they didn&#39;t have any soymilk sadly.\n\n\n        \n\n",

We walked around until it was time for dinner. This plant nursery was painted so cute. I feel like it could be in Berkeley.\n\nI tried to go to Alice in FantasyLand, but they didn&#39;t have anything on the menu that was vegan, and I would have just ordered a drink, but the staff said it would cost 2,000 yen just to sit down, so I figured I&#39;d rather spend the money on something cute to bring home and enjoy longer. I took some pictures though.\n\nWhen you go inside, you see optical illusions and can&#39;t tell how to actually enter the restaurant. It reminds me of a speakeasy.\n\nIt took us awhile to learn that the picture of the door in the giant storybook is the actual door to get inside.\n\nI think the train during rush hour in Osaka could be the busiest of all the trains I was on in Japan.\n\nCasa de Comidas La Paprika\n\nThis restaurant was soooooo good. I wish I could have eaten here again.\n\nOne of the things I liked about eating out in Japan that I think we should do in all countries is many gave you a bell to ring to call them over when you were ready to order. So smart! This one at this restaurant came in a cute disguised box.\n\n\n\nWhile we waited for our food, the waitress brought out charcuterie for us to taste some of the menu items. If she had brought it out before I ordered, I would have definitely got the soymeat. It was sooo good. All the tofu and soymeat in Japan tasted so much better than the U.S.\n\nDavid&#39;s salad had a carrot butterfly in it!\n\nMy risotto was boring looking but delicious.\n\nThe soft serve ice cream was delicous but it had granola instead of cereal. Not a fan. I prefer the way Tokyo puts cereal in the ice cream.\n\n        \n\n",

The decor was super cute, but the place was overpriced for what it was. The service wasn&#39;t great either.\n\nI only liked one of the cheeses on the cheese platter, but maybe that&#39;s because I&#39;m spoiled by Miyoko&#39;s cheese and the cheese platter at Encuentro.\n\nThe quiche-of-the-day was dry and flat and really not good at all.\n\n \nMatsuontoko\nThis place had amazing onion rings and brownies, but their burgers were so bad that I&#39;m not even going to post a picture of them.\n\n\nThis is the view from the train station by our air bnb.\n\n \nDay 2\nCafe Phalam\nI think I saw somewhere online that they weren&#39;t completely vegan, but everything in the pastry case was vegan and they made me a soy latte, so I can&#39;t really ask for more from a coffee shop.\n\n\n\n \nMonkeys!\nThese monkeys live in the mountains near Kyoto. There&#39;s a fee of $5 to hike up the mountain to see them. I think humans can buy food to feed them, but the humans have to go inside of a cage and stick the food through the bars to the monekys who are outside. I found this to be hilarious and thought of it as a human zoo where the monkeys can come to the zoo and see the humans in the cage.\n\nMost of them just chill and pick bugs off eachother.\n\nI was only slightly obsessed with this little baby monkey.\n\n\n\n \nPrunus\n\nPrunus is a well-located vegan restaurant near the train station you get off at to go the bamboo forest and to see the monkeys. I was extremely pleased with everything I had here, and I even made them a new location in yelp so others could find them more easily.\n\nThey even have a section in their menu about bird-friendly coffee, which I didn&#39;t even know was a thing.\n\n \nBamboo Forest\n\nWalking through the bamboo forest made me want to go home and plant a perimeter of bamboo around my house to keep muggles out.\n\nDoes anyone know what the dishes on the graves are for?\n\nI got really good at asking cashiers to help me read labels in stores. These are vegan.\n\n \nManga Museum\nI had a character drawing done at the Manga Museum, and apparently, if I were an anime character, I would look like this.\n\n \nKyoto Wakuden\nWe found this little fancy store that sold natural-colored salt. I could only afford to get the purple one, but I wanted them all.\n\n \n \nDay 3\nSentido\nI got to meet up with Alexis for coffee, which was so nice because I got to ask her how to say things in Japanese and listen to her order her coffee in Japanese and basically just be enamored by her cuteness for a few moments.\n\nSentido had cute cups, but I was disappointed by the number of coffee shops in Japan that couldn&#39;t do latte art with soy.\n \nHale\nHale is located in an outdoor mall in the center of Kyoto. While waiting for Hale to open for lunch (their hours are weird, so make sure you check them before going), we walked around the mall and bought cute candies and some Rilakkuma paraphenalia for mine and Jessica&#39;s houses.\nThe mall had the cutest vending machine I had seen in my entire time in Japan.\n\nThe mall also had a metamorphosis if you like expensive cute dresses with lots of ruffles and bows.\nHale is a little bit hard to find since it&#39;s wedged between two stands in a very crowded flea-market type area. Here is what the 2 stands to either side of it look like.\nLeft:\n\nRight:\n\nIf you&#39;re looking for a very traditional Japanese meal, then Hale is probably good for you. I personally found it to be a bit too authentic for me. It was vegan temple food, but the food was just a bit too different.\n\nI only ate about half of it, and I couldn&#39;t even use the bathroom because it was the kind with the hole in the ground.\nHowever, the walk to the bathroom was quite pretty.\n\n \n% Arabica\nThere are 2 location of this cafe. One is by the monkeys. The other is by a temple at the top of a hill. The one by the monkeys doesn&#39;t offer soymilk, so if you are looking for a latte, don&#39;t waste your time there. The latte at the one by the temple was quite good, but they&#39;re very strict about bike parking there, so maybe you should walk there.\n\n\n\nHere&#39;s another vegan snack I was able to find with some help from a cashier. Isn&#39;t it cute???\n\nAll the stores and shops in Japan were really into decorating for Halloween. It was so nice to see! This is inside the Kyoto train station (I think).\n\n        \n\n",

Since Kite Hill is already my favorite brand, and I would choose it over other non-dairy yogurts in a blind taste test anyday, I decided I should invite some unbiased friends over to help me with this activity.\n\nInstead of naming the yogurts on the scorecard, I decided to make this a blind taste test for everyone by assigning each kind its own letter. I then used little cups to serve the yogurt so nobody would know what brand they were eating.\n\nHere are all the yogurts we used in our taste test.\n\nSome of them ended up being so bad, that I rinsed the rest down the drain. I very rarely waste food, but there are some really really bad vegan yogurts on the market. (Tempt should throw in the towel on making yogurt and just focus on their delicious tofu and ice cream.)\n\nBefore giving you a synopsis of the winners for each category, I&#39;d like to share some of the comments that were made during the event.\n&#34;Tastes like ground-up vitamins.&#34;\n\n&#34;How does it look so smooth, but taste so chunky in my mouth?&#34;\n\nNeedless to say, this was quite an adventure for everyone. If you&#39;d like to watch the periscope we recorded during the event, you can see it on katch.\n \nWhich yogurt looked the best visually?\nThere was a 4-way tie for the best-looking yogurt between the following:\n\nKite Hill Blueberry\nKite Hill Strawberry\nKite Hill Vanilla\nKite Hill Peach\n\nWhich yogurt had the best texture/mouth feel?\nThere was a 3-way tie for the best texture between the following:\n\nCoyo Chocolate\nKite Hill Vanilla\nO&#39; Soy Vanilla\n\nWhich yogurt tasted the best?\nThe #1 best-tasting yogurt in our flavor category was Kite Hill Strawberry!\nThe #2 best-tasting yogurt was Kite Hill Blueberry.\nThe #3 best-tasting vegan yogurt was Kite Hill Vanilla.\n \nKite Hill was the clear winner by all 4 judges. While it was clear that some of us preferred certain Kite Hill flavors over others, Kite Hill was the only brand who we all scored highly. If you&#39;re interested in knowing who rated the lowest in any category or how a certain variety rated, leave a comment below.\nKite Hill yogurt isn&#39;t organic, but they use non-GMO, California almonds for all of their products (I highly recommend their cream cheese!). Their almond-milk-based yogurt uses the same probiotic cultures that are used in dairy-based yogurts, but Kite Hill yogurts are vegan. Kite Hill products are only sold at Whole Foods Markets, and they their yogurt comes in plain, vanilla, peach, blueberry, and strawberry.\n        \n\n",

Native Foods had already closed, so we had dinner at a muggle restaurant that had a lot of vegan options. It was called Palm Greens Cafe.\n \nPalm Greens Cafe\nI liked that you can get your own water, because then I can drink the same amount of water as a baby camel without feeling like an alien. The ceiling was decorated with pretty colorful paper lanterns to remind you to look up. Some of the vegan options on the menu specified Vegan in the name of the item, but some items that didn&#39;t specify were still vegan (like the Pho). All of the desserts were vegan.\nI ordered the Reuben and David ordered the Pho.\n \nWe had tiramisu for dessert.\n \n \nAce Hotel\nWe stayed at the Ace Hotel in Palm Springs, which wasn&#39;t my favorite for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to the following.\n\nthe first room they tried to put us in had a loud machine noise coming from the floor, so we had to change rooms\nthe curtains on the windows don&#39;t keep out the sunlight in the morning, so we were unable to sleep in\nthe door lock on our front door broke and we had to call maintenance to come and fix it\neven though our stay was for 2 days, our room key stopped working at noon halfway through our stay and we had to go to the lobby to have them fix it\nthe water didn&#39;t drain until your shower was over, so you were standing in an inch of your dirty water for the second half of your shower (except for me because I&#39;m perfectly clean all the time)\nthe housekeeping never came and cleaned between our 2 nights we stayed there\n\nThere were also good things about the Ace Hotel.\n\nIt&#39;s dog friendly, which means you get to pet other people&#39;s dogs when you&#39;re walking around outside. There&#39;s even a little dog park!\nThey serve Stumptown coffee\nThe pool doesn&#39;t close until 2am, and it has a floaty that looks like a donut\n\n \n\nThere are orange trees so you can pick oranges for your breakfast\n\n \n\nThe mimosas they serve at the bar (that you can sip poolside) are vegan\nThey have brilliantly posted signs\n\n \n\nThe grounds are covered with plants that hummingbirds like so you can make friends with hummingbirds\n\n \n\nThere are outdoor fireplaces you can sit by at night while you crochet socks for your chairs.\n\n \n\nThey have life-sized lincoln logs.\n\n \n \nSticking with tradition, we had chinese food for Christmas. We went to Supreme Dragon.\n\n\nPalm Springs also had gorgeous sunsets.\n\nAnother benefit about the Ace Hotel that I forgot to mention is that Tegan and Sara happened to be spending Christmas there with their family, so I got to see them offstage for my first time.\n\n \nNative Foods\nBefore leaving Palm Springs, we stopped at Native Foods where we met Scotty, a friend of Shane&#39;s. He&#39;s super sweet, and not only does he run this amazing vegan restaurant, but he also builds furniture! \n\n\nMe and Allium were super excited in the car on the way to Lucerne Valley. Trust me, this is her excited face.\n\n \nWolf Mountain Sanctuary\nI had mixed feelings about the wolf sanctuary. On one hand, I&#39;m really glad that someone exists who can rescue these wolves that would otherwise be euthanized. On the other hand, it saddened me to see them in cages instead of running around in the desert. What do you think about this?\n\n\n\n \n\nThey would do this really cute thing with their paw when they didn&#39;t want you to stop petting them.\n\n\n If you&#39;re like me and just can&#39;t get enough of these cuties, here&#39;s the periscope I recorded while I was there.\nOnce you&#39;ve already dirven 8 hours to get somewhere, driving 2 more doesn&#39;t really seem like a big deal (especially when I&#39;m not the one driving, haha). So, we decided to spend a night in LA so we could check out Moby&#39;s new restaurant: Little Pine.\nLittle Pine\nLittle Pine is a cute small restaurant in an area of LA that has a lot of parking, so we had VIP parking right in front. Even though we were accidentally early for our reservation, they sat us. The service was exceptionally friendly and helpful, and the food was phenomenal. Here&#39;s what we ordered.\n Broccoli Arancini\n\n Wild Mushroom Bruschetta\n\nTrio of Stuffed Shells: The one with olive filling had a pesto sauce, the one with spinach filling had a tomato sauce, and the one with artichoke filling had a cream sauce.\n \nCassoulet\n\nPB&amp;J Banana Split with bruleed bananas, peanut butter chocolate chunk and strawberry jam ice cream, hot fudge, and rice krispie treats. It normally comes with meringue, but I asked them to hold the aquafaba because I&#39;m not a fan.\n\n...and this is me with a happy tummy taking a picture in their bathroom with the cute pine tree art in the background that looks like a nature scene outside the window. I blame the delicious mulled wine for this behavior.\n\n \nWhen we were driving back to the hotel from Little Pine, we passed a house that had chandeliers in their front yard tree. I don&#39;t know if this is a year-round endeavor or if this is how they celebrate the holidays, but I almost knocked on the door with my suitcase in hand to ask them to adopt me.\n\n\n \n        \n\n",

Another reason is because...are you sitting down? IT&#39;S ALICE IN VEGAN WONDERLAND THEMED!!!!! It&#39;s as if someone created the perfect event just for me!\nIf you read my blog, you might be into some of the things I&#39;m into, which might mean that you&#39;re partially excited about this too. So, if you are, let me know about it!\nYou can find out everything you&#39;ve ever wanted to know about on the bayareasoiree.com website. Tickets are already on sale, and they&#39;re a great deal, considering you get free food and drinks once you&#39;re there. AND all of the proceeds benefit The Humane League!\nIf you decide to come, let me know so I can kiss your cute face! And probably dance together. And take pictures together. Okayyy..sappiness ending now.\n\nThe elegant vegan wrote the sweetest blog post about the vegan prom.

I somehow managed to make this just out of ingredients I bought from Costco (except for the yeast, which I always have at home because it stays good in the fridge for like ever and takes up a teeny tiny amount of room).\n \nPizza Dough ingredients:\n\n5 c white flour (costco has organic unbleached)\n2 c warm water\n2 t sugar (costco has organic)\n2 T active dry yeast\n2 t salt\n1 t garlic powder\n3 T nutritional yst\n2 T olive oil (costco has organic)\n\n \nPizza Dough directions:\nMix the yeast, water, and sugar in large bowl.  Add 3 cups of the flour. Mix well to blend.  \nAdd the oil, salt, garlic, nutritional yeast, and remaining flour and stir well.\nPlace the dough to a flour covered board. Dust your hands with flour.\nKnead for 5 minutes, adding flour if it gets too sticky. Roll dough into a ball and place into a lightly oiled bowl. Cover bowl with towel and set in a warm place for 45 minutes to an hour. \n \nPizza Sauce ingredients:\n\n1 can tomato sauce (costco has organic)\n1 can tomato paste (costco has organic)\n1 t basil\n1 t oregano\n1/2 t thyme\n1/2 t garlic powder\n1/2 t onion powder\n1/2 t pepper\n1/2 t salt\n\n \nPizza Sauce directions:\nMix everything together in a bowl.\n \nToppings:\n\nsliced mushrooms (I like the baby portabellas from costco to get my vitamin D)\nkale (costco has the huge bag of organic baby kale)\nspinach (costco has organic)\ndaiya cheese (costco has this now)\ngreen olives (I know traditionally people use black olives on pizza, but they&#39;re made with lye. Ew.)\n\nKnead dough again. Divide in half and roll half into a thin crust. Cutout shapes with a cookie cutter or knife. \n\nTop with sauce and toppings. I have this handy pocket pie maker that I got during valentine&#39;s day a few years ago, but you can just as easily use a fork to press the edges closed.\n\nPlace identical shape on top and press edges with a fork or your fingers.\n\nPlace as many as you can fit on a baking stone and bake for 10 minutes at 500º.  Remove from oven and let cool.\n\n        \n\n",

I made hearts. You layer them in between layers of paper towels for a few minutes to wick the moisture out of them. \nMake a delicious spamlike marinade by combining the 1/4 c olive oil, the 1/4 c braggs liquid aminos, and the 1/4 t hickory smoke. Then brush it onto the bottom of a glass pyrex baking pan.\nLay each piece of tofu into the pyrex pan as closely together as possible so you can fit them all.\nBrush the tops of the tofu pieces with the marinade using a pastry or silicone brush. If you don&#39;t have a brush, you can just use your hands and a spoon.\n\nBake the tofu in the oven (~350˚) for 20 minutes, and then flip them all over. Brush marinade over the other side. Bake for another 20 minutes. Cool.\n        \n\n",

You may have to scrape the sides of the blender with a spatula a few times. In a double boiler (or setting a metal bowl inside a pot of water), melt an entire bag of chocolate chips over boiling water. Stir the chocolate while it’s melting and when there are no more unmelted chips, remove form heat and add to blender. Blend further, scraping sides as before, until well-combined. Transfer to tupperware and chill.\n\nIcing Directions:\nUsing an electric mixer, whip up the first three icing ingredients, sifting in powdered sugar slowly (I add half a cup at a time). Pipe onto the top of cupcakes. Use a sifter to evenly sprinkle the cocoa powder on top of the icing.\n        \n\n",

        "content": "\n\n\n          Vegan Gluten-free Tofurkey\n        \n      \n        \n        \n          I don&#39;t mind the store bought tofurky, and actually really like the stuffing that the Turtle Island Tofurky has inside of it. Even Trader Joe&#39;s had a vegan tofurky this year (I have one in my freezer, but haven&#39;t actually sampled it yet). However, as far as I know, all of the store-bought ones are high in gluten, and I have quite a few people in my life who try to avoid eating gluten. That is how the birth of the homemade gluten-free tofurkey came about.\nThere are basically 3 parts to making this: the tofu, the stuffing, and the marinade. I didn&#39;t really use a recipe for the stuffing, but it wasn&#39;t gluten-free anyway, so hopefully I will post my gluten-free stuffing recipe soon. For now, if you&#39;re interested in viewing a recipe for stuffing that isn&#39;t gluten-free, you can see this one over at Thug Kitchen.\nThe photos in this post are from different years since I make this recipe every thanksgiving. Here&#39;s a video of me making this on periscope.\nTofu ingredients:\n\n2 pounds extra-firm tofu (preferably organic)\n½ teaspoon garlic powder\n½ t onion powder\n½ t smoked sea salt \n½ t salt\n\n\nMarinade ingredients:\n\n½ c olive oil\n½ c braggs liquid aminos\n\nDirections:\nRinse the tofu and wrap each block in a kitchen towel. Leave wrapped as long as possible, preferably overnight in the fridge. After they sit, while wrapped in towels, squeeze to get extra moisture out of tofu.  Crumble tofu into a bowl. \n\nAdd garlic, onion, salt, and smoked sea salt to the tofu. Mix.\nLine a mold with cheesecloth. \n\nIf you don&#39;t have access to cheesecloth, you can use parchment paper in a pinch. Feel free to use anything as your mold...a loaf pan, a bowl, etc. I used this cute little Wilton bundt cake pan I got in the baking section.\n\nPress tofu into mold to line all surface area with tofu approximately ½ – 1” thick, depending on the size of your mold.  Press with your fist and/or palm to make sure it’s packed tightly.\n\nCombine braggs and olive oil (equal parts) to make marinade.  \nAdd broth to stuffing (you don&#39;t want to add the broth until you&#39;re ready for this step or it might get too soggy) and then press stuffing into the mold inside the tofu.  Press firmly until mold is filled completely. \n\n\nTurn mold over onto an oven-safe pan (with sides) to bake tofurkey on, and tug on the cheesecloth if it doesn’t come out on its own. Lift off the mold.\n\n\nPeel the cheesecloth off carefully so as to not undo the cute shape you have created.\n\n\nBaste entire surface area of tofurkey with marinade including sides. I used a silicone brush.\n\nBake at 400º for 20 minutes covered with foil. Then remove foil, rebaste, and return to oven uncovered for 45-60 minutes (depending on the size), rebasting every 15 minutes. Remove from oven, slice, and serve.\n\nIf you happen to have any leftovers, I suggest reading this blog post to inspire you to make leftover sandwiches.\n\n \n        \n\n",

One of the appetizers on the menu was a chickpea patty cut into triangles and served with a fried caper garnish. It was soooo amazing that it made up for the fact that the boys had to go to the mall to buy shirts with collars because of the Wynn restaurants and their stupid ass dresscodes. For a few weeks after that dinner, I seriously just wanted to make a vat of fried capers, and carry them around with me forevermore so I could add them to everything I eat. I recovered from that stage and instead, decided to try to replicate the recipe at home.\nChickpea Hearts ingredients:\n\n1 c chickpea flour\n1.5 c vegetable broth\nolive oil\n\nChickpea Hearts directions:\nMake 1.5 cups of vegetable broth or use packaged. I used to buy the Rapunzel bouillon cubes, but it was so hard to get them to dissolve that now I buy this huge jar of vegan bouillon paste from Costco. I highly recommend it, because it&#39;s way easier to work with and tastes delicious. The only downside is that it takes up precious room in the fridge, and if you&#39;re like me, you likely don&#39;t have a square to spare.\nWhisk in 1 cup of chickpea flour slowly.\nRelax for an hour or so to give the mixture time to thicken.\nCoat a baking pan with olive oil, pour mixture into pan, and bake at 350° for a half hour.\nRemove from oven, let cool for 5 minutes, and cut into shapes with a knife or cookie cutters.\n\nFried Capers ingredients:\n\n1/4 - 1/2 c capers\n4 T safflower or sunflower oil\n\n\nFried Capers directions:\nDrain and dry the capers using a strainer, and then sandwich them between paper towels.\nHeat the 4 tablespoons of oil in a pan on medium-high while capers are drying. The benefit of using safflower or sunflower oil over using olive oil is that those oils can withstand a higher heat before turning into transfats. Olive oil is a low-heat oil.\nFry the capers until they start to change color (3-5 minutes).\nLine a plate with many paper towels and place the capers there to absorb any extra oil.\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n This recipe was shared with virtual vegan linky potluck.\n \n        \n\n",

Reduce heat to low.\nCut 4 inch squares of phyllo dough using sharp kitchen scissors. Be careful during this step. If you haven&#39;t used phyllo before, it&#39;s like trying to work with wet tissue paper...very delicate.

Can that be possible? My biggest qualm with school this year is that the children who could polish off an entire bag of popchips in approximately 85 seconds over the summer break are now all of a sudden &#34;not hungry&#34; when they&#39;re at school. I consider myself to be a pretty hands-off parent, but I basically only have to follow one rule in this parenting game—keep them alive. They&#39;re making it very difficult for me to follow my rule with this 8-hour-long daily fast. Also, I do not ever recall a time in my life (at any age) when I didn&#39;t feel like eating. Can I please have that problem??? I wish I could trade my appetite for theirs. But until I find a sorceress to perform that magic, I am racking my brain to try to come up with foods that they will be willing to take time away from socializing to eat. Unless these firm up tonight in the fridge (enough to hold in your hand and eat like a cupcake while walking around chatting), I think this might have been a failed attempt. But they&#39;re still super yummy.\nEnchilada Mini Cakes ingredients:\n\n1 onion, finely diced (I used a food processor)\na few tablespoons of olive oil\none can tomato sauce\n1 teaspoon garlic powder\n2 teaspoons chili powder\n1 teaspoon cumin\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon bouillon or 1 bouillon cube\n1 cup hot water\n1 package organic corn tortillas\n1 can black beans, rinsed\nvegan cheese\n\nEnchilada Mini Cakes directions:\nPreheat oven to 350°.\nGrease a cupcake pan with olive or other oil.\nSauté the onion in the olive oil on med-high heat.\n\nAdd the tomato sauce once the onion is soft and translucent.\nStir onions and sauce and reduce heat to low.\nAdd the spices. I usually measure everything into a small bowl before adding so I don’t get steam in my spice jars.\n\nStir everything well and let simmer on low heat.\nDissolve your bouillon in the hot water (or you can use premade veggie broth if you have it). I use the bouillon paste because it dissolves faster than the rapunzel bouillon cubes. You can get this huge jar at Costco for under $10, and it lasts quite awhile.\n\nAdd broth to pan and stir well.\nCut each corn tortilla into 4 triangles and place them into the pan of enchilada sauce burying them under the sauce to get warm and soft.\n\nRemove each triangle from the pan using tongs and place into the cupcake cubbies. You can use as many triangles per cubby as you like, but a minimum of 3 is recommended.\n\nRepeat this until all tortillas are used up or until your cupcake pan is full. My tortillas were used up before my cupcake cubbies were.\nScoop 2 teaspoons of rinsed black beans into each cubby.\n\nTop each enchilada cake with a scoop of cashew cheese or a sprinkle of grated daiya\n\nSpoon the remaining enchilada sauce on top of each enchilada cake.\n\nBake for 20 minutes if you plan to reheat some later or 30 minutes if not.\nCool for 10 minutes before removing from pan.\nServe immediately or store in freezer or refrigerator.\n\n        \n\n",

I usually double it and make 2 pizzas for my family of four so we can have leftovers for lunches. Today, I’m trying something different/slightly embarrassing, so I didn’t double it.\nPizza Dough Ingredients:\n\n2 cups flour\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 cup warm water\n1 teaspoon raw sugar\n1 teaspoon salt\n½ teaspoon garlic powder\n2 tablespoons nutritional yeast\n1 tablespoon yeast (or 1 envelope/package)\n\n\n \nPizza Dough Directions:\nMix the yeast, water*, and sugar in large bowl. Add 1 ½ cups of the flour. Mix well to blend.\nAdd the oil, salt, garlic, and nutritional yeast, and stir well.\n\nAdd the remaining flour and stir well.\nPlace the dough onto a flour covered board. Dust your hands with flour.\nKnead for 5 minutes, adding flour if it gets too sticky.\nSkip both of those last 2 steps if you&#39;re lazy like me, and have a kitchenaid to do your dirty work for you. While some people really enjoy the task of kneading bread dough, I prefer to save my valuable energy for more important things like playing Joust. Speaking of which...is it break time? Okay, I&#39;m back. I usually know that it&#39;s kneaded enough when it all starts to stick into a ball and clings to the dough hook.\n\nForm a ball with the dough and place it into a lightly oiled bowl. Cover bowl with a kitchen towel and set in a warm place for 45 minutes to an hour. Maybe the dough likes to play hide and seek before you bake it or maybe you don&#39;t want it to dry out while it&#39;s rising. I&#39;m 85% sure it&#39;s one of those 2 reasons.\n\nHere&#39;s the part in the choose your own adventure book where you must make an important decision that could affect the rest of the book. Are you going to make a traditional pizza or are you going to be a huge nerd (and I cannot believe I&#39;m admitting to this on the world wide web) and make a pampered chef tube pizza crust? If you chose the first option, continue reading from this point. If you chose the second option, skip to the row of stars and continue reading there.\nPreheat oven to 500º.\nKnead the dough once again.\nRoll the dough into the shape of pizza you would like using a rolling pin, and place onto a baking stone.\nTop with sauce and toppings.\nBake 10-15 minutes.\nRemove from oven and let cool.\n☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆\nPreheat oven to 375º.\nCoat the inside of your bread tube with some sort of oil. Have you seen the shape of one of these puppies? They don’t exactly look like the type of thing you can easily coat with the olive oil and a paper towel method.\n\n\nThe pampered chef broads probably wanted me to use Pam to spray the inside of this bread tube, but luckily, I have the hippie version of Pam: Spectrum coconut oil spray. This stuff is great for hard to reach places that need to be greased. I highly recommend getting some if you don&#39;t already have it.\nSeparate the dough in half (you only need 12 ounces of pizza dough for the bread tube). Get out your scale, change the switch from grams to ounces (because your European boyfriend uses it for measuring the exact amount of coffee and water to use in the chemex every morning), and plop what looks like half the dough onto the scale. Add or subtract until you get 12 ounces.\nRoll the pizza dough into a log shape and drop it into the tube.\nBake for 1 hour, and then place on a cooling rack. The hilarious part is that the instructions that came with this device tell you to always bake this thing vertically. I had to do some oven rack rearranging to make room for it, and it barely fit even after all that. So weird!\nRemove from bread tube once cool and slice.\n\n\nArrange the slices on a baking stone and top with a dollop of pizza sauce.\n\nAdd toppings.\n\n\nBake at 500º for 10-15 minutes.\n\n*The water should be around 100-110º. I’m lucky that I have a kettle that tells me the temperature of the water, but before that, I used to just estimate. I never bring food into bathrooms with me. I don’t even like to bring my water bottle into the bathroom with me. So, it’s almost difficult for me to type this sentence, but basically you want the water to be around the same temperature as bathwater. Clean bathwater. The cleanest bathwater.\n\n        \n\n",

(arf! arf!) These doggie donuts are cake donuts with a solid chocolate coating like Little Debbies or Entemann’s donuts. Before I was vegan, I used to go to the Entemann’s outlet store and buy multiple boxes of the chocolate covered donuts at a time. I was an addict, and the list of ingredients was so long, I’m surprised they could fit them all on the side of the box! When I first discovered this donut recipe on VeganYumYum many years ago, I was so excited to finally be able to feed my addiction yet again. My inspiration for these doggie donuts was born when I was in Hawaii and Japan in 2015 and saw so many cute donuts with animal faces. They were all pastel colored and made to look like different animals, and I knew immediately that the world needed a vegan version. This recipe makes 9 donuts.\nDoggie Donut ingredients:\n\n2 cups unbleached flour\n1 tablespoon baking powder\n½ teaspoon salt\n½ teaspoon nutmeg\n¼ teaspoon cinnamon\n1 cup sugar\n1 cup vanilla soymilk (or substitute any non-dairy milk)\n½ tablespoon apple cider vinegar\n½ tablespoon vanilla extract\negg replacer for 2 eggs (I used ener-g)\n½ cup vegan butter (or substitute any vegetable oil)\n\nDoggie Donut directions:\nPreheat the oven to 350°.\nMix the wet ingredients in a saucepan over low-med heat until the margarine melts and sugar dissolves (the wet ingredients are the last 6 in the list).\nMix the dry ingredients together in a bowl (the first 5 in the list).\nMix the dry and wet ingredients together just until incorporated.\nPress the batter into 9 ungreased donut-shaped molds.\nBake for 13-15 minutes.\nRemove from oven and place pans on cooling racks.\nRemove donuts from the pans using a flexible silicone spatula, by shimmying the spatula down the sides of the down so far that it curls all the way underneath each donut (start this step only when completely cooled).\n \nChocolate Coating ingredients:\n\n1 12 oz bag of chocolate chips\n\nChocolate Coating directions:\nMelt the chocolate chips in a double boiler (or in a saucepan on low).\nPaint the melted chocolate onto the cooled donuts using a silicone spatula.\n \nDecorations ingredients:\n\nEars: 5 large dandies marshmallows or 18 minis (You can substitute fondant.)\nEyes: 18 white chocolate chips (You can substitute any similarly-sized candies or sprinkles.)\nNoses: 9 round pink, red, or white sprinkles (You can substitute any circle-shaped edible decoration)\nMouths: 18 long pink, red, or white sprinkles (I use Lieber’s, and if I dig around, I can usually find some curved sprinkles that make the doggie look like he’s smiling.)\n\nDecorations directions:\nCut each marshmallow into 4 slices if you&#39;re using large dandies.\nShape each marshmallow slice into a dog ear using your hands. Set each one on parchment paper as you finish.\nChoose your facial features, and separate out 9 sets of them so they’re ready to place.\nPaint the top of a donut with chocolate using a silicone pastry brush. If you don’t have a silicone brush, dip the top of a donuts into the melted chocolate. Set it on a cooling rack or parchment paper, chocolate side up.\nPlace 2 ears on the donut and press lightly into the melted chocolate.\nPlace the nose, mouth, and eyes, using kicthen tweezers if you have them. Repeat process with each donut.\nChill all 9 decorated donuts for 15 minutes (or freeze for 5 minutes) to harden the chocolate.\n\n        \n\n",

I had a different blog back then at ieatcupcakes.com where all my pictures were taken with an iPhone so they all looked really bad. Here was my original post. Now I have created my own lentil loaf recipe that I prefer over many others that I&#39;ve tried. This recipe makes 15 lentil lovelies.\nLentil Loaf ingredients:\n\n1 c dry lentils\n⅓ c millet\n3 c vegetable broth\n2 T ground flax seed\n¼ c warm water\n1 T extra virgin olive oil\n1 small yellow onion\n1-5 cloves of garlic, to taste\n2 celery stalks\n1 carrot\n1 parsnip (or sub another carrot)\n1 t salt\n1 t black pepper\n1 t thyme\n¼ t rosemary\n¼ t sage\n½ c oat flour\n2 T ground flax seed\n¼ c mashed potato flakes\n2 slices of toast\n¼ c ketchup\n1 T molasses\n\nLentil Loaf directions:\nRinse the lentils and millet.\nBoil the broth, lentils, and millet in a medium-sized pot.\nCover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until liquid is absorbed (30-60 minutes), stirring occassionally.\nPreheat the oven to 350°.\nCut 15 squares of parchment paper and use a glass or your hand to press the paper into each cubby of a cupcake pan, making sure the parchment paper hangs over the edges by an inch or 2.\nWhisk the flax egg with 2 T ground flax and ¼ c warm water.\nProcess the toast until it turns into breadcrumbs and set aside.\nPeel the onion and process it in a food processor (or dice by hand).\nSauté the onion in olive oil in a cast iron pan over medium heat.\nProcess the carrot, parsnip, garlic, and celery until they&#39;re chopped finely (or dice or grate by hand).\nAdd the carrot, parsnip, garlic, and celery to the pan and sauté for 5 more minutes.\nAdd the spices to the pan, and remove from heat.\nProcess over half of the lentil/millet mixture.\nMix the lentils, millet, flax egg, breadcrumbs, flax egg, veggie mixture, oat flour, and additional ground flax seed. Stir well.\nScoop the mixture into each cubby of the muffin pan (lined with parchment paper) using an ice cream scoop if you have one.\n\nPress the scoops down into the cubbies with the back of the scoop.\nBake the little lentil loaves for 15 minutes, and remove them from the oven.\nMix the ketchup and molasses together to create a BBQ glaze.\nSpread the glaze on top of each little lentil loaf.\n\nBake the glazed little lentil loaves for 10 more minutes.\n \nMashed Potatoes ingredients:\n\n2 pounds potatoes\n¼ c organic earth balance\n½ - 1 c almond milk (or sub any unsweetened, unflavored nondairy milk)\n1 t salt\n½ t pepper\n\nMashed Potatoes directions:\nPeel the potatoes, cutting off any bad spots.\nCut the potatoes into one-inch cubes, place in a pot, and cover with water.\nBoil the potatoes on high heat, reduce heat to medium, and boil for 15 minutes.\nDrain the potatoes in a colander in the sink.\nTransfer the potatoes back to the pot, add the earth balance, salt, and pepper, and mash with a potato masher.\nTransfer the potatoes to the bowl of a stand mixer and affix with the whisk attachment.\nWhisk the potatoes adding nondairy milk slowly until the potatoes are a creamy consistency (pictured below).\n\nTransfer the mashed potatoes to a piping bag. Pipe potatoes onto lentil muffins.\nGarnish the lentil lovelies with parsley and/or paprika (optional).\n\nThese can be made in advance, chilled overnight, and reheated in an oven for 15 minutes until mashed potato tops have browned slightly.

You can also use pink decorating icing or pink sprinkles for the cheeks, but I used pink cake sparkles from Wilton.\n\nCut slits into each side of the donuts where you want to insert the ears.\nRemove the ears from the freezer.

It should be a dark violet-indigo color.\n\nFill the lightly oiled mini cake pans just over halfway until all the batter is used up. It should fill 5 mini 4&#34; cakes or 12 cupcakes. I use the mini springform pans by Wilton. Place the pans on a baking sheet to make them easier to remove from the oven.\nBake at 350º for 34 minutes (or 20 minutes for cupcakes).\n \nLemon Cream Cheese Icing ingredients:\n\n1 8oz package vegan cream cheese (or you can use homemade)\n¼ c package silken tofu (blended)\n¼ c organic earth balance\n2 t vanilla\n2-3 cups powdered sugar (to taste)\njuice and zest from half of a lemon\nsoymilk powder (optional for consistency)\na few fresh blueberries for garnish\n\n \nLemon Cream Cheese Icing directions:\nBeat the margarine, cream cheese, blended silken tofu, lemon, and vanilla extract together.\nSift in the powdered sugar, a cup at a time.\nBuild the cake, gluing together the layers with icing.\n\nPour over cooled cakes using an offset spatula to help spread it around.\n \nHere&#39;s another variation my stepmom made using blackberry puree instead of lemon in the icing, and making them in baby bundt cake pans.\n\n        \n\n",
