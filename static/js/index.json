day","href":"/blog/art-and-wine-festival","content":"After attending a couple of vegan beer fests and jpop summit recently I told myself to start avoiding activities where there are large amounts of people This epiphany was based on a couple of factors one being the fact that I dont really care for other humans and the other being that I dont have the patience to wait in long lines before getting what I want So when I found out there was an art wine festival a few blocks from my house I was a bit hesitant to attend However the thought of walking around carrying my polka dotted wine glass helped me get over any doubts I may have had Since I wasnt sure what vegan wine options there would be we started our walk with a glass of wine from home called Barrel 27 High on the Hog from 2010 Upon arrival I was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasnt as crowded as the events that had scared me away from attending such festivals There was far more art than wine for sure and the only vineyard I actually talked with was Bonterra where I discovered that their white wines are vegan but not their reds Another benefit of their winery is that theyre not only organic but biodynamic I think I might visit their winery next time Im in Mendocino In case youre ever unsure whether a wine is vegan and you dont have the opportunity to talk with the winery in person thenbspbarnivore websitehttpwwwbarnivorecomwine is a good resource they also have a phone app called vegaholic Some of the art we saw that we liked included a woodworking booth where we bought the cutest cutting board and serving tray its reversible I have ever seen with 6 or 7 different types of wood in it Its made by a small shop called Hardwood Creationshttpdavidlevycreationscomnbspthats located near Sacramento Heart cutting boardimagesphoto2jpg There was also a vendor there that made the most adorable dresses but theyre only in kiddo sizes Why do kids get all the cute clothes So I of course had to come straight home and make a similar but enormous dress to fit me handmade dressimagesartwine10jpg Since I have no boobs I made the back and front the exact same size and shape so I can choose each day which way I want to wear it Maybe I was secretly trying to follow the reversible theme that my new cutting board had spawned other side of handmade dressimagesartwine11jpg Another enticing thing I saw at the festival was a little girl eating a delicious looking ice cream cone I dont think downtown Mountain View serves vegan ice cream cones anywhere so I decided to make my own at home I started with a box of plain cones Lets Do Organic ice cream conesimagesartwine1jpg Next I melted about a third of a bag of chocolate chips melting vegan chocolate chipsimagesartwine2jpg While the chocolate was melting I gathered up some sprinkles and such I know it can be difficult to find vegan sprinkles trust me Im constantly on the lookout Here are a couple of brands that I know of that are vegan but if you have other suggestions please comment below One thing Ive been looking for forever that I cant seem to find is vegan starshaped sprinkles I have them on my tattoo but have never had them in real life If you know where to get them I might propose marriage vegan sprinklesimagesartwine3jpg Once the chocolate is melted dip the cone into it dipping ice cream cones into chocolateimagesartwine4jpg Coating ice cream cones in chocolateimagesartwine5jpg Next before the chocolate dries dip the cones into vegan sprinkles or shredded coconut or cookie crumbs or mini chocolate chips or anything really Adding vegan sprinkles to ice cream conesimagesartwine6jpg Covering ice cream cones with vegan sprinklesimagesartwine7jpg Then let them air dry Or if youre impatient like me and have been craving an ice cream cone since you saw a little girl eating one hours before then stick them in the freezer for 1015 minutes Ice cream cones with vegan chocolate and sprinklesimagesartwine8jpg Once the chocolate has hardened top with ice cream Ive been on this kick for the past couple of months where I only want to eat the chocolate salted caramel ice cream from Steves because basically all other ice cream tastes subpar after having that kind Cute vegan ice cream conesimagesartwine9jpg So yeah thats how the art wine festival basically wrote the agenda for my entire day"},{"title":"Bay Area

Chefs","href":"/blog/blind-tiger-dining","content":"Finally I have been wanting to try SM Vegan for months now since I first heard of them and I finally got lucky enough to try it I cant recall how I first heard of them early this year but I think I joined a meetup group in hopes of either attending or hosting one of their elusive popup dinners After realizing that their meetup group was relatively inactive I saw them listed as a vendor at the east bay vegan beer fest So even though I was packing to move that weekend I drove to the east bay just to partake in this infamous reuben Sadly the event was so crowded and the lines were so long that I had to depart before being given the opportunity to try some of their delectable fare Soon after Republic of V tagged SMveganhttpinstagramcomsmvegan on instagram to show off their sandwiches they started carrying So I started following them in hopes of maybe having better luck with my stalking ahem I mean finding out about their events before theyre over And it worked Just days before Davids birthday they posted that they had 3 tickets left to the blind tiger dinner which was taking place a couple of days from then Since the location was a secret when I purchased the tickets Im guessing thats the blind part of the blind tiger dinner This couldnt have been more perfect since I had not yet thought of a birthday present for David On the day of the event the location was announced and I left early to make sure there wasnt some autoinduced death or sportsball game causing a traffic delaynothing would keep me from finally tasting this mysterious cuisine Since traffic seemed to be in my favor I had time to stop at Republic of V to pick up Miyokos new cheese which is delicious and I highly recommend it to anyone who has yet to partake The location of the event was in a warehouseart studiooffice building of sorts with a skylight and ideal lighting so lucky for you these pictures look 3465936 times better than any I have ever taken at Millennium While waiting for the remaining 18 diners to arrive we talked with Dan who owns Bison Breweryhttpbisonbrewcom We learned all about his brewing techniques how few certified organic breweries there actually are in the United States and how his partnership in the blind tiger dinners is such an integral part of the event Im not much of a beer drinker so I didnt actually benefit from this but there were beer pairings with 5 of the 6 courses at dinner including a Red Reuben beer with the reuben course and a chocolate stout with dessert We also learned that much of the food we ate during the dinner was cooked using the bison beer So apparently I do like beer afterallit just has to be prepared by Shane and Marie in the form of exquisite noms Course 1 Tacos There were 3 kinds of tacos Red chili pepper stuffed with cashew cheese trumpet mushroom and eggplant tacosimagesSMvegan1jpg rellenos pepper stuffed with cashew cheese inside a tortillaimagesSMvegan2jpg Course 2 Salad with tapenade shards In case you missed that I said tapenade shards This is complete and utter brilliance They looked so cute sticking out of the salad like thin purple crackers but more importantly if you think you like olive tapenade you will LOVE these The salad also had green zebra tomatoes early girl tomatoes and massive croutons that I couldnt eat in one bite from Morrells Bread I get the feeling that SMvegan gets all their ingredients from local sources saladimagesSMvegan3jpg Course 3 Smoked popcorn This was smoked popcorn on top of a teeny tiny potato the size of a grape stuffed with potato and shiro miso on top of a shiso leaf I was glad this course was tiny because even without drinking beer I was already starting to feel like I might not make it through 6 courses And I love all the shades of purple in this dish smoked popcornimagesSMvegan4jpg Course 4 Polenta This ragu dish had polenta mushrooms almonds and tongue of fire beans The crazy thing is that when Shane was introducing the dish and mentioned the tongue of fire beans I thought it was something new I had never heard of But once I googled it I see that they are the beans Ive been buying at farmers market that are being referred to cranberry beans Needless to say it was delicious I had seconds even though I was getting full polentaimagesSMvegan5jpg Course 5 Buildyourownreuben slate This was the best thing everrrrrrrrrrr Not just because I had been waiting to try their reuben since vegan beer fest but because this seitan could easily be the best seitan I have ever tasted In life Seriously I guess it was marinated in the red reuben beer that was paired with this course Shane said he slices it by hand It was the perfect thicknesslike 05 mm Ha Not really but I hate how every packaged seitan at stores is so thick Who wants that Im pretty sure nobody wants that but vegans are too nice to be fussy So on behalf of all vegans everywhere please seitan makers slice it thinner I also learned that Shane and Marie might be willing to be talked into selling their seitan in quantities of 5 pounds or more so if anyone wants to share some seitan with me you know where to find me sitting in the vegan dollhouse kitchen with piles of seitan in my lap hands and mouth I also loved how this dish was served on a piece of slate The presentation of the entire meal was so pretty And those cured beets were so delicious The butter next to the bread was handmade using maize Okay I could go on and on about this course alone but I will stop now For you buildyourownreubenimagesSMvegan7jpg Course 6 Dessert I almost didnt think I would have room for dessert but then I remembered that Im mewhich means my dessert stomach is a completely different one and there is infinite room in it Ive never made creme brle before because it doesnt contain chocolate so I figured whats the point But now that Ive tasted it I understand the point Finally my neglected torch will be coming out of the cupboard This one was made with almond milk and corn which was a nice reprieve from the typical coconut everything I tend to make imagesSMvegan10jpg I didnt take any pictures of the way everything was laid out but basically everyone sat at a long table with the dishes with the exception of dessert being served family style I even made a friend who sat next to me taught me about all kinds of new things and we even have plans to decorate vegan cakes together in the near future These blind tiger dinners apparently take place the last Sunday of every month so if

adventure","href":"/blog/bunny-island","content":"Can you think of the happiest youve ever been in your life Maybe there are a lot of different experiences that come to mind Mine was a couple of weeks ago on Bunny Island My life is basically downhill from here haha I should probably start by admitting that I dont really go outside Im not outdoorsy I dont spend my weekend mornings hiking I dont camp Its just not really my thing So it is possible that part of the euphoric experience of Okunoshima for me was just being in nature The island of Okunoshima itself is gorgeous Unlike the islands near San Francisco it wasnt rocky and super steep It was relatively flat which made for easy bunny access and a remarkable view of the sunset from the island bunny island sunsetimagesbunnyisland8jpg Even just the traveling to the island on the train was beautiful I loved everything about my visit and Im counting the days until I can go back Next time Ill stay longer than only one night I brought a lot of snack to eat on the long train ride including these heartshaped chips that we picked up in Harajuku imagesheartchips1jpg imagesheartchips2jpg After taking a whole bunch of train rides you arrive at a port where you wait for the ferry In case youre unsure of where to wait theres a helpful sign bunny island ferry waiting areaimagesbunnyislandjpg The ferry ride to the island makes you feel like youre in a scene from Jurassic Park bunny island ferry rideimagesbunnyislandjpg The hotel was a traditional Japanese hotel so at 6pm or so they come around to your room and lay out your sleeping pads on the japanese mat floors Theres a toilet and a sink in your room but the showers are in the public onsen so if you go I hope you dont have an issue with being next to naked peoplewhile youre nakedand if youre me you might have to watch other people shower so that you can learn what to do because youve never been in an onsen before And thats not awkward at all Dont worry I waited until I was alone before taking these picturesnbspof the onsen Just because I stare at people while they shower doesnt mean I dont know where the line is drawn and when not to cross it except for those times when I just touch my toe across the line but that doesnt count right bunny island onsenimagesbunnyislandonsenjpg bunny island onsenimagesbunnyislandonsen2jpg The hotel comes with an allyoucaneat buffet for dinner and breakfast I just assumed there would be nothing I could eat so I packed a lot of snacks for the trip However to my surprise the staff were really helpful and the other tourists too so I was able to find quite a lot of vegan food to eat there I still recommend bringing snacks though because the hotel doesnt provide lunch and the trip to and from the island is a long journey in itself Heres a picture of some of the food that was vegan on the breakfast buffet okunoshima island hotel vegan foodimagesbunnyislandbuffetjpg There was also cold tofu seaweed salad and other things that I didnt care for In addition to bringing snacks for you you may want to bring snacks for the bunnies This is a decision each vegan must make for hisherself The island doesnt sell food for the purpose of not wanting the bunnies to become reliant on being fed There are plenty of plants on the island that they can eat so I think the ideal situation is to let them eat what they are meant to eat However I was gifted a bag of grass pellets from a japanese girl and I fed the bunnies every last pellet It made them come to me and sit on my lap and made me the happiest Ive ever been in life so when I go back I will be feeding them I hope that doesnt make me a bad vegan I created a youtube channel specifically for videos of Bunny Island so if youd like to see bunnies hopping around in their natural habitat check them outhttpswwwyoutubecomchannelUCwkKvKRQXtX3yfGohNiUw Oh and youtube wont let me change my URL for my channel until I have 100 followers so please subscribe to my channel

to bunny island The bunnies are hunted by crows so some of them have wounds on their ears and faces from the crow attacks I had the chance to save a baby bunny from being taken by a crow but then it

tiramisu for dessert Vegan Tiramisuimagestiramisujpg Ace Hotel We stayed at the Ace Hotel in Palm Springs which wasnt my favorite for a number of reasons including but not limited to the following the first room they tried to put us in had a loud machine noise coming from the floor so we had to change rooms the curtains on the windows dont keep out the sunlight in the morning so we were unable to sleep in the door lock on our front door broke and we had to call maintenance to come and fix it even though our stay was for 2 days our room key stopped working at noon halfway through our stay and we had to go to the lobby to have them fix it the water didnt drain until your shower was over so you were standing in an inch of your dirty water for the second half of your shower except for me because Im perfectly clean all the time the housekeeping never came and cleaned between our 2 nights we stayed there There were also good things about the Ace Hotel Its dog friendly which means you

such a huge part of my diet I have a coffee addiction A big one I limit myself to drinking coffee twice a day but in actuality I want to drink it all day long The second I finish drinking it I wish there was more and the only reason I eat lunch is so that I can earn my second cup of coffee The first time I ever had cold brew was at cafe gratitude about 10 years ago They explained the process to me as being a healthier way to consume coffee that required no heat except for in the roasting of the coffee beans of course My favorite thing to order from cafe gratitude since then has been their coffee milkshake made with cold brew Then a couple of years ago I started seeing cold brew being sold in bottles at stores My friend Eidelyn got me some Stumptown cold brew for my birthday a couple of years ago and Ive been hooked ever since Buying cold brew is rather pricey around 10 a bottle so making your own is a good compromise because obviously living your life without it is NOT an option Its super easy to make and the great thing is that you can use coffee that isnt as high of quality and it still comes out tasting really good Blue Bottle coffee in San Francisco uses peaberry beans to make their iced coffee Apparently the peaberry bean is kind of known for making good iced coffee so I use it for my cold brew Peaberry coffee from Trader Joesimagescoldbrewjpg Ive noticed that everyone makes theirs a little differently so my way is just one of many The first thing of importance is to grind the beans to a mediumcoarse grind I use a burr grinder so I usually set it to 35 which is about the same coarseness I use when grinding for french press coffee The amount of beans depends on how much cold brew you want to make I try to use a ratio of 16 with 1 part coffee grounds and 6 parts cold water My french press happens to be the larger one so it can hold 1 cup of grounds and 6 cups of water making cold brewimagescoldbrew2jpg Without a french press you can just make this in a jar or a bowl It doesnt really matter where you soak the coffee as long you remember to stir it every few hours When you add the water make sure its room temperature or colder And then give it a good stir so that all the ground become wet making cold brew coffeeimagescoldbrew3jpg I usually brew mine for about 12 hours Some people only brew it for 8 hours You can experiment and see how mild or flavorful you like yours To strain it you can either use a french press or just pour it through a filter on a chemex or a coffee dripper Ive been so hard up for coffee before that one day when I left my chemex at work I rested a funnel in the top of a glass pitcher Get creative with whatever you have lying around You can drink the cold brew as is over ice cold brewimageswisdomtoothweekend10jpg Or if youre like me and you like your coffee to taste like coffee flavored ice cream you can add coconut creamer cold brew with coconut creamerimageswisdomtoothweekend11jpg and soymilk cold brew with

food coloring","href":"/blog/diy-food-coloring","content":"So I really like things that are cute and colorful I try not to show favoritism between bright colors and pastel colors but I will admit that when it comes to food the bright colors catch my eye a lot more A good example of this would be the difference between Lets Do Organic cake sprinkles and the rainbow sprinkles made by Liebers I know that the Lets Do Organicnbspones are better for me but theyre so light and barely noticeable when sprinkled atop white icing that I really prefer using the Liebers But then I end up only adding sprinkles to half of my cupcakes so I dont have to actually eat the cute sprinkles This is only one of the many slightly crazy things that I do but its worth noting since its kind of the inspiration for this endeavor While were on this topic can I just raise the issue of how disheartening it is that my favorite food is brown Brown The world has enough brown dont you think Recently I made a rose cakehttpvegandollhousecomrecipespistachiorosecake and I was trying to use enough rose petal powder to make the cake pink I must have added a quarter cup of rose powder and then it was so light that I ended up adding a drop of Wilton food coloring to get it to be pinker Its only a drop so I dont really feel too bad about using it once in awhile but lets face it If I could add colors to all of my foods without sacrificing the healthiness I probably would So this is where the experiement of making my own food coloring began The rose petals did color the cake mix a bit so that was good But the reason it didnt dye it enough was because the powder was such a light pink color to begin with So what I needed was a darker pigment I started thinking about what foods have dark pigments Beets was the obvious first answer Purple potatoes are pretty inside but only before you cook them and raw potatoes are a nono Carrots are pretty if you are looking for bright orange colors which I rarely am but since Halloween is coming up orange could come in handy Of course berries are really pretty too I decided to start the experiment with things I already had on hand before investing any additional money into this just in case it turned out to be a disaster I had beets and carrots in my fridge so I peeled a few of each Peeled beets and carrotsimagesfoodcolors1jpg I dont know about you but my ability to evenly slice fruits and veggies and basically anything is nonexistent People always ask me how I can sew such a straight line Thats probably how a chef would feel if you asked them how they cut such uniform slices Its easy Pshh Luckily I have kitchen tools to do my bidding so I used my food processor on the slicing side Then I laid all the slices out on my dehydrator trays Beets and carrots ready for the dehydratorimagesfoodcolors2jpg I set the dehydrator to 125 degrees which is what the excalibur recommends for veggies I checked on them after 24 hours and when I tried to snap a beet in half it folded instead of snapping I felt that they could be more dry so I dried them for over 48 hours before taking them out I imagine you could do this in an oven at a really low setting if you dont have a dehydrator but Im not sure what effect it would have on the color If anyone has tried this Id love to hear about it When I got them out of the dehydrator I started by using my blender

Berkeley","href":"/blog/east-bay-excursion","content":"Ive been wanting to check out Sanctuary Bistro in Berkeley since they opened a few weeks ago I finally had a free day so I planned a few other east bay activities to partake in before din din It started with a trip to East Bay Depot where I found some Hello Kitty stationary and a lavender tablecloth for only 6 Since we were right next to Sacred Wheel we stopped in to share a grilled cheese and learned that now they have quite a few vegan items on the menu They had a gazpacho which was a nice alternative to the Pabst Blue Ribbon tomato soup that I usually order to dip my grilled cheese in Another nice change was that instead of daiya they now make their grilled cheese with a nutbased cheese thats quite good Next was Artis for their famous vanilla almond milk lattes They make their own vanilla from vanilla beans so its quite a treat While I was paying for my latte I noticed a sign near the register that they carry Genuto a locally made gelato that I recently heard about but havent tried yet When I asked the cashier about it she informed me that they use it to make vegan affogatos It was too late for me to change my order and much too late in the day to have 2 coffees so Ill have to go back for that Sipping a vanilla almond milk latteimageseastbaydate2jpg After Artis we hit up the Crate Barrel Outlet Store on the same block where I got 6 cute new dishes to match the square white set I currently have from there Of course no trip to Berkeley would be complete without a trip to Republic of V They didnt have the new cool whip I was looking for but I did manage to find these new items that I hadnt tried before Tofurkey Quiche and breakfast sausages chocolate covered cocomels and Vtopian cheeseimagesrepublicofvjpg The sea salt chocolate covered caramels were super good The sausages are a lot different from the field roast breakfast sausages theyre bigger theyre saltier and they taste more like real meat I think I prefer the field roast ones When we first got to Sanctuary Bistro they somehow didnt have our reservation and it took them about 5 minutes of looking concerned and worrying us before they finally agreed to let us stay That was kind of annoying but then when we sat down they had black napkins in these cute fork napkin rings so I quickly forgot about the rocky start imagessanctuarybistro6jpg For each thing we ordered Ill list a description paste a picture and give my opinion on how it was Artisan plate Flax crackers with cashew chevre pecan mousse and citrus tofu with a side of roasted rosemary figs Artisan plateimagessanctuarybistro1jpg I wasnt a fan I dont know what chevre is supposed to taste like since I havent eaten cheese in 15 years and when I did it certainly wasnt anything fancy This cashew cheese was really bland The good thing about it was its smoothness which is usually my challenge when I make cashew cheese The pecan mousse was too sweet for my liking The tofu tasted lemony and was better than the nut cheeses which is soooo weird because I usually dont like tofu I tasted the fig and it tasted smoked which I also wasnt a fan of Overall this was a waste of 14 for me MacadamiaMiso salad Romaine lettuce avocado Eatwell Farm cherry tomatoes and tempeh croutons with a macadamia miso dressing Im sorry I didnt take a picture of this one but I was kinda starving at this point Haha It just looked like a caesar salad nothing special I liked the dressing a lot but the croutons were NOT croutons They were soggy and the flavor wasnt a nice crouton flavor It was just pieces of tempeh but when youre expecting croutons its a grave disappointment Carrot Pt Compliments of the chef atop a cucumber slice Carrot pateimagessanctuarybistro2jpg This carrot pt was really yummy and was my second favorite thing we had This was given complimentary to all the diners and probably should be on the menu considering that I liked it more than many of the things we ordered Also it was cute to see it served on a cucumber slice since that was how I served my artichoke pthttpvegandollhousecomrecipesartichokepate that I made a couple of months ago Crabless cakes Oyster mushroom patties with microgreens and a remoulade sauce Vegan Crab Cakesimagessanctuarybistro3jpg These were the best thing we ordered They tasted like they were made with Bulghur Wheat or Kasha They had oyster mushrooms as well as a lot of other veggies I think I liked the tartar sauce the best It had a ton of dill in it which made it super delish Im probably going to try to make these at home sometime but mine will be cuter shapes than circles Ravioli Filled with mushroom duxelle in a spinach cream sauce topped with braised carrot and zucchini Mushroom Ravioliimagessanctuarybistro4jpg The flavor of this was good but the consistency of the ravioli was really weird It tasted thick and doughy and more like dumplings than ravioli Ive been wanting to make my own ravioli but this was discouraging It makes me think its more difficult than I had imagined because they most certainly did not nail it Decadent Chocolate Parfait Chocolate mousse with coconut whipped cream topped with a mini almond butter cup Chocolate mousseimagessanctuarybistro5jpg Im not sure that decadent is the right word to describe this It was good dont get me wrong but I think the chocolate parfait at veggie grill is more decadent than this was The mousse was quite light and airy which is hard to do with vegan mousse in my opinion The coconut whipped cream tasted like it had lemon zest in it which was unusual The almond butter cup was tasty and similar to the ones I make In addition to the fiasco we had with our reservation being lost and some of the food being less than desirable there were other strange happenings that made me feel like this restaurant had a curse put on it or something Not once but twice different servers managed to spill water either on themselves or on the poor women dining at the table next to ours Also even though our table was the furthest from the kitchen the noise of dishes clattering was so loud that at a couple points I almost plugged my ears Im not sure whats going on with the acoustics in that place but maybe they should turn up the music to drown out the sounds clanking from the kitchen All in all I wont be going back to spend 90 on a subpar dinner Id rather spend 30 more and go to Millenium for a fine dining experience that I know I will enjoy and where I am always treated in very high regard by the

blatant LIE was the copious amounts of presents that children would receive on this particular occasion as opposed to the infiltration of holidaythemed songs in every public location during the entire month or the abundance of fruitcakequite possibly the worst dessert ever invented Although I dont actually celebrate Christmas I do think that the holiday has a few redeeming qualities One is mistletoe because well who wouldnt love a parasite that encourages random make outs But my favoritest thing about Christmas is decorating gingerbread houses Michaels craft store actually sells a veganbydefault gingerbread house kit which I took advantage of last year since they went on sale for 99 cent just before New Years However I didnt actually want to eat it after enjoying its beauty for a few weeks because although it was vegan it definitely wasnt organic and probably wasnt very delicious either Earlier this year I was browsing a websitehttpwwwthingiversecom filled with 3D printer blueprints deciding on what fun things I could ask David to print for me when I found thishttpwwwthingiversecomthing43661 Im not sure who to credit for this brilliant idea spindledev but Im pretty sure they had my thingsRobinwouldwishforifsheknewtheyexisted list in their possession when inventing it Ive been slowly transitioning my beliefs mainly after years of hanging out with Pamela that everything is cuter when its been minified except for dogs so naturally I couldnt wait to make these I knew I had to at least wait until December but in order to pass the time more quickly I gave myself an appetizer task of making invitations to send to friends in hopes that they might like to join in on the gingerbread dollhouse decorating as well imagesinvitesjpg I used a recipe from the PETA websitehttpwwwpetaorglivingfoodmakevegangingerbreadhouse to make the gingerbread and the glue icing Here are all the walls ready to go into the oven pictured with the cookie cutter from the 3D printer imagesgingerbreadprebakedjpg And here they are after coming out of the oven imageswallsbigjpg The 3D printer blueprint only produced a cookie cutter for one of the 3 pieces needed for this project so I had to improvise with paper templates for the other 2 If I hadnt been on a deadline and was smarter then this method might have worked However I wasnt using my skills learned in woodshop class and therefore there may have been a requirement for the gingerbread house construction workers to partake in some slight nibbling of 2 of the 4 walls while building their dollhouses Nobody seemed to mind this task with the exception of Josipa who seemed to think her nibblingstopping willpower didnt stand a chance against the deliciousness of the gingerbread We were all very proud of her for stopping before hers turned into a 2D gingerbread house and for being the first builderette to produce a completed house Her superior construction skills were no surprise since shes the only one

so hers will not be displayed individually but she made some amazing vegan brownies with walnuts to make up for it We had a visit by yet another Jessica jlsuttles because one Jessica is never really enough is it Not only did she make the only burtonesque gingerbread dollhouse but she also made the best looking and most structurally sound one I was shocked at how amazing her mini gingerbread house

person voted for the conventional costume contest Theyre over it They wanted something new The option receiving the most votes was to have a Halloweenthemed food contest Since Halloween is my favorite holiday and making themed food is my favorite way to cook I was really excited to come up with something cute cute is not another word for scaryI dont like scary food So I decided to make bats and pumpkin hummus Luckily I had a photographerassistant during this process because making bat crackers actually takes a lot longer than one might expect It was as if I were genetically engineering real bats in my kitchen You can use any cracker recipe from the internet I made one up but I didnt think it was actually that tasty so I wont share it with you Once you roll the dough out as thinly as possible you use your batshaped cookie cutter to make as many bats as possible imagesbat1jpg If you dont dip the cutter in flour between each bat the bats will stick into the cookie cutter each time like this imagesbat3jpg If that happens just push it out with your fingers imagesbat4jpg Lay all your bats onto a baking stone If you dont have a baking stone get one Until then just place the bats

way","href":"/blog/how-to-make-your-couch-purple","content":"Ive wanted a purple couch for like ever I see them now and then about as often as I see purple cars and admire them from afar Since I tend not to spend much money on things that arent edible not including rent and bills I dont usually get the chance to own specialty items unless I make them myself or my friends gift them to me Luckily only because Im a glass halffull type of personotherwise I would consider this quite unlucky when David and I combined houses I was basically gifted a very pale grayishbeigish Ikea Kivik sofa When we first put it in the living room with my pretty black and green furniture it must have felt like an outsider My furniture isnt the type to make fun of others but theres no way Davids couch has been feeling at home here After many attempts at finding reasonablypriced covers for this sofa I finally started looking at alternatives Some people paint their couches which looks really good when its done but I was slightly concerned about the comfort of the sofa afterwards Thats when I settled on dying it Ive ordered dye from Dharma before and I like their quality so I contacted them to find out which dyes were vegan Every color that is a Fiber ReactivenbspProcion Dye is vegan I ordered the following items from Dharma 4 oz deep purple colored dye 1 pound soda ash fixer 5 pounds salt Total cost w shipping 25 Dharma shipmentimagessofa2jpg Step 1 Remove the cover from your couch The kivik is easy because it comes in a lot of pieces and theyre all attached to the wooden sofa with velcro Sorry I didnt take a good before picture but heres David taking the sofa apart Taking the cover off the ikea kivikimagessofa1jpg Step 2 Prewash the cover They tell you to use their special soap but I just used my regular ecofriendly soap that I use for all my laundry They also say to use hot water but I was scared that my cover would shrink and not fit back onto the couch so I used warm I also have a front loading washing machine which makes it harder than using a top loading machine but one advantage to the LG front loading machine is that it has a setting for bulkylarge loads so I used that Since the dye needs to be soaking into the fabric for a certain period of time the tricky part of dying things in a washing machine is that you have to stop the machine before it goes from the wash cycle to the rinse cycle so while I was prewashing I actually sat in my garage in front of the washer and stared at it until it switched from wash to rinse so I would know the exact moment when it would happen On mine that moment is between 31 and 29 I know that wasnt a completely exact moment but Jessica was texting me a crazy story about a text she got from one of her coworkers so how could I not get distracted Step 3 When the washer is done remove the damp covers from the washer and set them on the floor or a table until youre ready to put them back into the washer At this point I refered to some instructions that someone contributed to the Dharma website herehttpwwwdharmatradingcominformationgarmentdyeinghtmllnavinformationhtml and put my own twist on it Step 4 On the stovetop boil a half of a pot of water using your largest pot Then slowly add the salt a cup at a time dissolving each cup thoroughly I used a whisk before adding the next cup I think I used a total of 8 cups of salt When it was completely dissolved the water still looked really white like paint water salt waterimagessofa3jpg Step 5 Use a medium sized glass bowl for the dye Add the dye and then add warmhot water and stir with a plastic spoon This is where some people use Urea to help mix the dye so you dont get tiny dark spots but urea isnt vegan and I am dying dark purple so spots wont show up like they would if I were dying a pastel color Dharma Fiber Reactive Dye Dep Purpleimagessofa4jpg Step 6 Start the washer After 12 minutes pause the load and when the door unlocks open it and pour in the salt water Then close it and start it again Step 7 Pause the washer after another minute or 2 and open the door once it unlocks Add the dye mixture Then start it againnbspLay some rags on the floor in front of the washer because the next time you open it some dyed water will drip off the door onto the floor Step 8 After another minute or 2 pause open and add the fabric Then start the load again Step 9 Five minutes before your washer is about to switch to the rinse cycle or more if youre concerned about time mix your soda ash I did this by using my largest pot the same one I used for dissolving the salt and filled it 23 to 34 full with hot tap water I then added a cup of soda ash and whisked it until it was completely dissolved and the water turned clear 23 minutes Step 10 Pause the washer turn it off turn it on turn the dial to the wash setting you used before mine was BulkyLarge and start it Then every 3060 seconds add about 34 cup of the soda ash water to the soap compartment Whenever the soap compartment is empltied again fill it Repeat this until you have used up all the soda ash water It took me the entire length of a wash cycle about 22 minutes plus part of a second cycle until it was gone One of the many wash cycles in the purple dyeimagessofa5jpg Step 11 Remember no matter what before the cycle switches to rinse pause the washer turn it off turn it on turn the dial to the wash setting you used before mine was BulkyLarge and start it You never want to let it get to the rinse cycle or it will drain all your dye and ruin your life or maybe just the day Step 12 Youll want to repeat the washing cycle at least twice after the soda ash water is completely incorporated For darker colors you can even do it a third time Im impatient so I only restarted twice Step 13 Once your fabric has been agitating in the dye and soda ash for a minimum of 30 minutes and a maximum of an hour let the wash cycle run its complete course Make sure that when its on the rinse cycle that the water temperature is turned to cold Step 14 When that load is complete you want to wash it once last time as you would wash any load of laundry with detergent and fabric softener They say to use hot water but again I was scared of shrinking my cover so I used cold Step 15 Drying Ideally to make sure you dont shrink your fabric hanging things out to dry is the best However Im a bit short on places to hang large laundry items such as sofa covers so I put mine in the dryer on ultra low We had some difficulty getting the covers on so I would suggest using all cold water and not using the dryer to dry them purple sofaimagessofa7jpg Freshly dyed purple sofaimagessofa6jpg Shared on tutorial tuesdayshttpwwwhopestudiosblogspotcom201505tutorialtuesday12htmlnbspand wicked awesome

dessert I immediately started brainstorming how I could make it as cute as her Okay thats not possible but I at least had to try Strawberry shortcake has this connotation for me at least as being this hard biscuit with shapeless pieces of strawberries strewn about and a glob of whipped cream Its not an attractive dessert The colors are nice but that almost always happens when youre willing to sacrifice taste ahem chocolate for looks brown is just not a cute color pretty much ever So after a lot of brainstorming I finally narrowed it down to 3 possibilities Keep in mind this dessert will be served at a bar so it cant be a big beautifulnbsplayered cake with perfect triangle slices on cute colored plates with bamboo utensils This isnt that kind of birthday party It has to be a lowmaintenance easytosneakintosomewhereifneeded easytoconsume type of dessert So the 3 finalists 1 layered in small mason jars 2 A swirl roll but Ill have to put it on a lollipop stick or skewer to keep it from being too messy to eat or 3 Bite sized strawberry shortcake hors doeuvres Okay while I know Jessica likes the swirl and would very much appreciate it I dont think I want my first time experimenting with something difficult to be on her birthday So now I have it narrowed down to 2 Since I dont yet have a dishwasher I think Ill choose 3 The plan is to make biscuits that arent too hard and to use the cute scalloped cookie cutters that I borrowed from Jessica to cut out cute bitesized biscuits Then Ill cut each strawberry into heart shapes Then I have to attempt to make a whipped cream that will hold up outside of the fridge for a number of hours this is the real challenge I think I nailed it The scalloped heart biscuit Heart biscuitimagesStrawberryShortcakeBiscuitjpg

Last year she requested the same cupcakeshttpieatcupcakestumblrcompost33220426853saltedcaramel that I had made the month before for Jessicas birthday which were apparently a big hit however Josipa deserves a new recipehttpvegandollhousecomrecipesvegantiramisurecipe for her birthday because shes the Cutest Croatian Cupie C3 doll in the world I was trying to decide what type of cupcake to make when I remembered a time forever ago forever approximately 6 years that Josipa and I tried to make tiramisu I say tried not because we didnt succeed in creating the dessert but more because it was quite possibly the worst tiramisu in the history of tiramisu Josipa is an excellent cook and Im not the worst cook in the world but somehow the Robinsipa combination failed Im pretty confident that our failure was attributed to us both adding the required amount of baking soda therefore causing the entire dessert to taste like a baking soda cake Also we doubled the recipe so we were stuck with a ridiculous amount of this undesirable treat So I did what everyone does when theyre stuck with too much of a bad thing I brought it to work to pawn it off on my coworkers If time travel is ever possible I might use it to reverse that decision due to the relentless way my coworkers have teased me to this day Basically my takeaway from this and I hope its also a lesson learned vicariously through me for others reading this is that if youre trying to sell people on veganism dont introduce them to vegan food by feeding them something gross I had been forming an idea in my mind for a few days of how I wanted to make these cupcakes so I headed to Whole Foods and I coincidentally ran into the birthday girl in the banana aisle for ingredients where I was inspired by looking at their bakery case and seeing a tiramisu that was served in a cup made out of chocolate It totally reminded me of the scene in Willy Wonka where he sips the tea out of the daffodil and then bites the cup The only decision I hadnt yet finalized is what type of cup to serve it in since I would be layering it So I decided to try to make chocolate cupcake wrappers out of melted vegan chocolate chips by using a silicone pastry brush to paint a thin layer of chocolate in the inside of my silicone cupcake wrappers they were very excited to be used twice in one day after a month or two of neglect imagespaintingjpg I left them in the freezer overnight to form the perfect level of resistance to the abuse that the placement of the tiramisu layers was sure to cause Heres the hard part taking them out of the silicone wrappers without damaging them I had a 810 survival rate due to a learning curve So unless you have already participated in this activity you should probably make more than you actually need since some will likely be casualties The secret to doing this I found is to take only one at a time from the freezer so the others dont melt loosen the wrappers from the chocolate all the way around the perimeter and then turn the silicone wrapper inside out to get the chocolate cup to come out without breaking imagespoppingjpg imagespopping2jpg I made the cupcakes with a vanilla

this one so it was kind of an experiment Ive only been hearing about them for the past month or so From what I understand its sort of similar to the process of making sauerkraut so it has a lot of the same health benefits even though it only has about an hour to ferment I used to make sauerkraut before I worked so much I heard from someone who stayed at the hippocrates institute to combat cancer that they serve sauerkraut with every meal Once I found that out I started making it because cabbage is cheap but raw sauerkraut is usually quite pricey If you google the reasons why sauerkraut is good for you to eat regularly youll find more reasons than youll be able to read in a day They range from digestive aids to glowing skin to natural antibiotics to increased enzyme count to diminishing the craving for sweets and on and on and on Most pressed salad advocates talk about how theyre easier to digest than regular salad but that could be said for the chopped salad as well Remember the last salad fad The New York restaurants chopped up the salad ingredients so tiny that you didnt even really know what was in your salad The upside though is that it would decrease the amount of work your body has to do with chewing and digesting So I guess the real question is when youre pressing salad for only an hour is that even enough time for your salad to grow any probiotics Chi Energyhttpwwwchienergycoukpressedsaladrecipehtm says you can get probiotics from only 1015 minutes of pressing your salad What do you all think All you have to do to make this is chop up your salad ingredients massage them with salt like you do when you make kale salad and press into a glass or ceramic vessel traditionally sauerkraut is made in a crock but you can use anything in your kitchen really Top with another glass or ceramic dish and then top with something really heavy to push all the air out I used some little heart ceramic dishes I got from Daiso for only 150 each

chocolate ganache Oh noooooo She of course requested a combination of things I have zero experience in Jessica requested chocolate salted caramel cupcakes As if making vegan caramel anything wasnt challenging enough she also mentioned that her party was Adventure Time themed If you like me are not a watcher of this cartoon you probably dont know how difficult these characters would be for someone with little to no artistic talent to draw with icing Challenge 1 Creating a recipe from scratch that includes vegan caramel I dont even really know what caramel is supposed to taste like since I think Ive only had it one time in the 13 years Ive been vegan This is how I knew I needed to recruit a nonvegan helper to be my tastetesterhelperelfkitchenslave Luckily I ran into Terence the week before Jessicas birthday at the Octogalahttpstoreorangephotographycom4ced83achfdd39edhfdd39ed and offered him a trade which he shockingly accepted The agreed upon exchange was that I would assist him with the birthday card that he was making for Jessica and he would assist me with the cupcakes Little did he know that I unknowingly manipulate people into assisting with 34764059 more things than they originally commit to because I always make the mistake of thinking that I can turn 6 hours into 12 somehow So 2 days before we planned to meet up we were chatting online about cupcakes and such and I reminded him that Jessicas adventurethemed birthday was taking place in the form of a picnic at Dolores Park While Terence wanted to make some fancy salad that he had ordered at a restaurant a few nights before that I was trying to stick with the theme of cute which if you know Jessica you would know that this should be and is the theme of everything in her life So we settled on these as an alternative to Terences fancy salad Rainbow Tomato Kabobs Photo credit goes to Terencehttpwwwflickrcomgroups2052081N23poolwith7681398232 imagestomatorainbowkabobsjpg imagesfeattomatorainbowsjpg And of course because I think I have that ohsospecial ability to somehow squeeze 12 hours out of 6 we also made the following Rilakkuma Rice Bears imagesricerilakkumajpg And that is not all Oh no that is not all So I remember quite a few years back the day of the missing spoon that I will never ever forget Jessica had another birthday picnic at Dolores Park maybe its one of those traditional birthday party themes that gets reused every few years and she made spam musubi I had never even heard of musubi but she went to the trouble of making a vegan version for me on HER birthday Isnt she the sweetest and I have to say I have loved musubi ever since Then when I visited her in Hawaii we went to a vegan restaurant that made spam musubi and it was soooo good So in the spirit of tradition Terence and I decided to invent a vegan spam musubi recipe because all the recipes I found online sounded awful Normally musubi isnt exactly what one would call cute and we had already decided that everything we make for Jessicas birthday has to be cute so heres a stepbystep tutorial on how to make cute vegan spam musubi Steam 1 cup of rice Then make your spam recipehttpvegandollhousecomrecipesveganspam While the spam is cooking season your rice however you usually season it for sushi I added rice vinegar and sesame seeds and press it into cute shapes that you can find at Diaso Terence and I used flowers imagesmusubi1jpg If you have fancy scissors you can cut nori strips with cute edges but normal scissors work fine too imagesmusubi2jpg Place 2 strips of nori set your rice flower down top is with a spam heart and wrap like a present imagesmusubi3jpg Whats a present without a bow No present at all imagesmusubi4jpg Terence also has this skill that I had never heard of before called plating So he was in charge of all plating for this event Look at the personalized bento box he plated for Jessica imagesbentojpg So this was the part of the night where I came to the harsh realization that I actually DO NOT have the ability to squish 12 hours of activities into 6 and everything started going badly Maybe not bad lets just say that making vegan caramel was a bit more challenging than I had expected The first batch got thrown away The second batch ended up becoming too hard and turned into caramel candies instead of caramel sauce At that point I was so exhausted that instead of attempting a third time we then decided to sprinkle the candies on the cupcakes and sprinkle the salt and pretend that it was perfectly just the way we planned for them to turn out imageschocolatesaltedcaramelcupcakesjpg Challenge 2 How to make them Adventure Time themed at 3am Thank goodness for Terence or I would have disappointed poor Jessica arriving

have a bunch of already hot food bar items that you can order take out from but they also make smoothies and fresh juices I ordered the Beatnik juice since it was the only one with beets in it and I figure if Im at a place called Beetroot I should probably be drinking beetroot juice imagesbeatnikjpg There was a clothing store called Monki that had the cutest decor that I had to go inside Too bad the clothes werent cute at all But look at this adorableness that housed the inferiorly aesthetic clothing imagescutestoresohojpg imagescutestore2jpg imagescutestore3jpg After another successful bicycle transport we arrived at Regents Park where they had rows of cherry blossom trees as far as the eye could see imagescherryblossomsjpg The cheese and cracker picnic would have been better if the crackers didnt taste like styrofoam but I counterbalanced that problem by increasing the cheezly to cracker ratio to 8020 imagespicnicjpg Theres a portion of Regents park called Queen Elizabeths circle that is supposed to have something crazy like 20000 roses but of course they were all just rose branches in April so instead we found a mini waterfall imagesgardenjpg imagesgarden2jpg Next stop was a vegan boutique that Ashley told me about called Vx imagesVxjpg It was super tiny but they had a good variety I bought some stuff that I didnt take pictures of and I tried to buy these adorable shoes but they didnt have them in my size Waaaahhhh imagesVxbirdieshoesjpg They had some cheese there called Teezini that I really wanted to get but our hotel didnt have a fridge so I didnt get it 3 imagesVxcheesejpg I was crazy excited that they had vegan eclairs because the only time Ive ever had one was at Millennium so it was probably a million dollars for one Sadly however the filing tasted nothing like eclair filling so Im back to my mission to search the planet for a decent vegan eclair imageseclairjpg We met up with friends at a pub called Public Bar in Soho where they served Samuel Smiths All their beers were marked as vegan except 2 They even had a statement on their menu about how their brewery was the first one to register with the Vegan Society is that the same as the secret society of vegans that Ashley is now an honorary member of imagessamuelsmithmenujpg David ordered the chocolate stout which with an exception of the smell was barely a distant relative of chocolate Although I guess it tasted more like chocolate than that time Jessica convinced me to taste her beer that she insisted tasted like candy when we were at the Belgian bar in the Tenderloin in SF imagesbeerjpg The girl sitting next to me had a really gorgeous purplish reddish drink which she told me was called a black cider Its apparently cider mixed with black currant juice How could I resist trying that It was delicious This picture isnt the best I blame Ernesto for showing the pretty color of this beverage but trust me that it looked as pretty as it tasted imagesblackciderjpg Mildreds was only 2 doors down from Public Bar which was super convenient Mildreds almost always has a wait so if you decide to go there you should put your name on the list and then go to Public Bar for a black cider while you wait imagesmildredsmenujpg I ordered a drink called pornstar which had a half of a passion fruit floating it Sorry I didnt take a picture I think this could be the first time I have ever tried passion fruit fresh I didnt like the consistency of the seeds at all and considering that it doesnt have a square millimeter that is seedfree I think this may be the kind of fruit that I will only be enjoying in smoothies forevermore The appetizer was dumplings with this really yummy dipping sauce that I couldnt replicate or describe in any amount of articulation besides yummy imagesdumplingsjpg My dinner was the mushroom pie which was a bunch of different kinds of mushrooms in a wine reduction sandwiched between 2 layers of crust made from phyllo dough It came with mashed peas sprinkled with dill delicious and a combination of mashed white and sweet potatoes Im not a huge fan of things cooked in wine so I probably wont order this again but it was still yummy and our server commented on how happy I looked so I must have been enjoying myself imagesmildredsjpg The end of Day 2 landed us at a bar called Borderline for a dance night called Bedrock In spite of the website describing it as Yeah Yeah Yeahs and LCD Soundsystem type music as well as the fact that Blanca recommended it as being fun it was the most broey nonfun dance night that I have visited in a long time Note to self When on vacation stick with pubs"},{"title":"Spring Break: London (Day 3)","tags":[],"section":"blog","thumbnail":"/images/Cakes-drinks.jpg","date":"2014-04-20 16:41:50

if it were customized for Robins Things that make this place so amazing include the following Super cute and sweet staff I was so enamoured by the selection that I probably asked way too many questions that would have led any San Francisco cafe staff member to pierce my soul with a stare of hatred but here I got not only patience but I actually learned things For instance the sausage they serve with their English breakfast was so delicious that I had to ask what kind it was I learned all about how Paul McCartney yes of The Beatles has a vegetarian family and his daughter has a line of vegetarianvegan mock meats This of course led me on a journey to try to find the sausages to take back to Spain I may have also acquired some frozen sausages wrapped in pastry puff that were soooo goood Adorable decor This ranges from the doilyesque furniture to the tattoo font on the menu chalkboards to the flash art sheets in themes of cupcakes and sweets to the EVERYTHING For proof see the one million pictures Im about to post below Allvegan menu By the name you might assume that they serve cake and tea They actually have so much more Of all the traditional English breakfasts I had while in London there were 4 this was by far my very favorite Their coffee menu was more extravagant than Starbucks I dont mean this as an insult It actually reminded me of the flavor options at one of my favorite cafes in the US Grindcore House in Philly They had 4 milk options They also had vegan snickers bars Custom cakes While Im not really a fan of fondant they had the cutest vegan cake that was themed after Corpse Bride As if they hadnt already won me over imagesCakeswindowjpg imagesCakeschandellierjpg imagesCakesbirdcagejpg Who has a teapot shaped chalkboard Seriously

imagesCakesbreakfastjpg I know that going to a chain when youre traveling is boring You should try to experience new places as a local However that being said going to chains to see the differences can be neat For instance Starbucks in Spain all have fresh squeezed orange juice I love that So I was excited to go to a Whole Foods in London to see what foods they had that were different It was basically ALL of them I was most excited by the vegan cheese section where I acquired some Vegusta to bring back to Spain It was a new kind I had never had before with herbs in it Here are some pictures I took of the rest of the cheeses that Whole Foods had imagesWFcheesejpg imagesWFcheese1jpg imagesWFcheese2jpg imagesWFcheese3jpg My best find at Whole Foods was organic Hello Kitty pasta I wanted to buy 127649598 of them but luggage space is always an issue when traveling so I could only get 4 It might also have been because there were only 4 packages left on the shelf Tesco stores arent really anything special Theyre kind of like the equivalent to Safeway in northern California or Ralphs in southern California However we had to go there to find the sausages and they had a number of other cute andor yummy vegan things imagesTescopombearjpg imagesTescocheesejpg imagesTescopeanutsjpg Itadaki Zen is an organic and vegan japanese restaurant It differs from ChaYa in that it seems more authentic This authenticity is not only obvious in the food options but also in the fact that there is a zen garden inside of the restaurant imagesItazaki2jpg imagesItazakijpg After leaving

Adventure","href":"/blog/spring-break-london-edition","content":"If you travel by Ryan Air youll find yourself arriving in STN which is an hour outside of London If you arrive at midnight like I did you may opt to stay the night at one of the airport hotels and head to London in the morning In addition to the benefit of going to sleep sooner the hotels by the airport are also cheaper than the ones in London I chose the Radisson Blu because hotelscom had a room with free wifi and breakfast After chatting with a local on the airport escalator and determining that Londoners dont drink the tap water my first purchase upon arriving to the UK was a bottle of water from the hotel bar that cost the equivalent of 750 It was bottled on an organic farm in Wales but for 750 Im picturing it being bottled by baby lambs which makes me feel okay about the cost imageswaterjpg Normally I assume that Ill be lucky to find an apple some orange juice and a bowl of oatmeal when American hotels offer free breakfast but this was more like dining with a royal family compared to that They had a ridiculous buffet of every breakfast item you could imagine but even more because it was a traditional english breakfast so add fried tomatoes sauteed mushrooms baked beans etc There were a surprising number of vegan options and they even had raw sugar and soy milk for the cereal and coffee imagesradissonbreakfastjpg After a 45 minute train ride with a beautiful view of the countryside along the way the next stop was to check in to our new hotel The Wesley and head to Camden Town There may have been 2 unsuccessful attempts to rent bikes Sheep seemed to have zero problems doing it last time before deciding to walk I feel so lucky that the weather is gorgeous and sunny with no rain during my stay Last time I visited I remembering it being much colder and somewhat wetter The only vegan restaurant I could find that served a traditional english breakfast on a Thursday was inSpiral Lounge but I do not recommend it They were out of sausage and told us they would sub bacon but instead they subbed eggplant The tofu scramble and sauteed mushrooms were good but the rest wasnt worth a damnespecially not for 15 The baked beans tasted like they mixed a can of navy beans with a can of tomato sauce imagesinspiralloungejpg In addition to the mediocre food a number of other factors turned me against inSpiral Lounge which include but are not limited to their inability to run my credit card their nonexistent wifi that they claim to have and an extremely difficult secret password written in invisible ink process of using the loo After leaving inSpiral I knew only one thing could make me feel betterCookies and Screamhttpcookiesandscreamcom imagescookiesnscreammenujpg imagescookiesnscreammenu2jpg Last time I was in London 2 years ago I tried to go here for an espresso milkshake but they were closing by the time I got there so I had to order something else Ive been waiting this entire time for the espresso shake and it did not disappoint imagesmilkshakejpg We may have also ordered a mint brownie to take back to the hotel for later Can you blame us Just look at them imagesmintbrowniejpg Youd think after all of that the pigginess would end but nooooo We stopped at the Holland Barret health food store in Camden Town to check out their vegan section imageshollandbarretjpg I wish our hotel room had a fridge so I could have bought one of everything but instead I only bought some cheezly to eat with crackers in the hotel Ill have to eat it all really fast since theres no fridgelife is so hard I wanted to get the cheddar but David is more of a risk taker than I am so he talked me into trying the edam kind I dont even know what it is so Ill report back once I taste it imagescheezlyjpg Also whats up with Tofutti playing favourites They dont make these flavors of cream cheese for us Nor do they make cute little single serving sized packages for us I dont know about you but I never manage to get through an entire package of cream cheese so these little baby sized ones would be perfect for me I could take them to work travel with them hide them for easter would that be weird the list goes on Who wants to help me write some letters to Tofutti imagestofuttijpg Manna was my favorite vegan restaurant in London They claim to be the oldest vegetarian restaurant in the city so it must be their years of experience that has made them so awesome I ordered the bangers and mash since its supposed to be Londons specialty like ordering curryworst when youre in Berlin It consisted of a layer of mashed potatoes topped with a layer of gravymarinated kale topped with 2 delicious housemade sausages and to my surprise and happiness was topped with onion rings All of this floated in a sea of gravy I loved it The mashed potatoes were made with dill which gave them a potatosaladlike taste that was quite refreshing The coating on the onion rings was much lighter than the veggie grill onion rings making them seem a bit closer to a tempura onion ring The sausage was divine The flavor was perfect with just the right amount of sage and the consistency didnt taste like meat so it was great for someone who doesnt like eating mock sausage that has that gristly substance to it imagesbangersmashjpg David ordered the polenta which looked so pretty on the plate due to the addition of beets and kale imagespolentajpg For dessert I was excited to see petite fours on the menu Ive only had vegan petite fours once before which is when Jessica and Pamela made them for my birthday tea party Ive seen them often when having tea with nonvegans so Ive come to have an expectation of what they should look like I will admit that I was slightly disappointed when the petite fours arrived to our table and looked like this imagespetitefoursjpg However they were still delicious the next day when we ate them with tea in our hotel room The other aspect of Manna that made it so awesome other than the amazing food was the decor They had this really cute wallpaper with birdies hanging out in trees and the ceiling lights were made to look like tree branches imagesbirdwallpaperjpg Day 1 came to a close with one last tube ride back to the hotel I felt like I spent 25 of Day 1 on the underground My synopsis of the tube is that it smells better than the metro in NYC but it still has a weird underground basement smell that Im not fond of imagestubejpg We decided that for the rest of the London vegan adventure we would try to stay above ground as much as possible"},{"title":"Sweet Potato Biscuit Thanksgiving Sandwich","tags":[],"section":"blog","thumbnail":"/images/heart.jpg","date":"2013-12-01 01:10:36

me the email informing me of the change and a bountiful harvest The only harvest I actually participated in this year were some really cute pale green pattypan squash and a plethora of late blooming

The mall has around 10 floors and there are 3 coffee shops distributed around The elevators in the mall have a really cute voice I think the only other elevator Ive been in that talked to me was the Twitter building elevators but this one was cuter because it was in Japanese The mall also had a juice place which sold a lot of familiar american vegan snacks The first cafe we tried was on the bottom floor and looked a lot like blue bottle so much that Im pretty sure they ripped off their logo cups and everything else about them but they didnt offer soymilk The second one was a success so we never visited the 3rd one The Theatre Coffee made a really good soy latte with cute latte art but it was a bit pricey my first soy latte in TokyoimagesScreenShot20151002at45641PMpng Pure Cafe David had eaten dinner at Pure Cafe before and wasnt impressed with their food so we decided to just order dessert only It was one of the only places open before 11am so it one the contest for next

Deus Ex Machina My favorite coffee shop in Tokyo was in Harajuku Its called Deus Ex Machina They have soy lattes and do cute latte art Kurt thought it looked like lumpy space princess imageslatteartjpg A trend I noticed in hip coffee shops in Japan were copper piping sinks I saw this in at least 3 different cafes imagescoppersinkjpg One of the only times we got stuck eating at a restaurant that wasnt vegetarian and didnt have an English menu or any English speaking staff was in Harajuku We ended up at a place called Oriental Recipe and Cafe thats around the corner from the Tamagachi store at the end of TakeshitaDori Luckily I pasted a bunch of Japanese characters into my journal before the trip so I could point to characters The restaurant had a vegan salad or this vegan curry imagesorientaljpg They also sold these really cute heartshaped vegan snacks that we bought and ate later on our train ride to Okunoshima Giant Black Cat David read on twitter that there was a giant black cat in the Shinjuku train station puking out presents so we obviously had to go to get souvenirs for Josipa Heres a flipagramhttpsinstagramcomp8agAFjqYWN of our visit Kuumba du

wasnt going to go because Happy Cow listed it as vegetarian but she assured me that most things could be made vegan so we went for breakfast It was hard to find places open early in Japan because places typically open later and stay open later at night so I was super excited that Island Veggie was open before 9am I ordered a chocolate peanut butter banana shake imagesislandveggie3jpg David ordered a ham sandwich and it came with a free coffee This sandwich was less than 700 yen making this one of the most affordable options I found in Tokyo vegan ham and tomato

Tower imagestowerjpg The Tokyo Tower is only 1 or 2 stops away from Island Veggie so we decided to check it out The tower itself wasnt very interesting Its a super tall tower However because it was in Tokyo it had all this other cute stuff like a One Piece themed cafe and store imagestower4jpg imagestower3jpg I tried to go to the cafe but they didnt offer soymilk The word for soymilk is tonyu so I basically just got into the habit of walking in everywhere and saying tonyu None of the themed restaurants and cafes I tried to go to offered anything vegan imagestower2jpg Since we got denied at the cafe theres a park nearby that we walked around in imagestower5jpg La Petite Pattiserie de Mirayne This vegan bakery was a huge disappointment Do not waste your time going here The first time I went they were closed The second time I went they were out of mostly everything imagesbakeryjpg imagesbakery2jpg We got the black pepper crackers and the lemon cookies and they were 1000 yen for the tiniest containers But after going all the way there twice it was out of the way of everything else we had to buy something The pepper crackers had wayyyyy too much pepper Heres Jack carrying the bag of overly priced baked goods imagesbakery3jpg Lima Lima is a health food store with an almost allvegan cafe We came here to look for snacks for our trip to Bunny Island but we ended up staying and eating lunch I highly recommend this place imageslimajpg imageslima2jpg imageslima3jpg imageslima5jpg imageslima7jpg And then after eating we found all these snacks to bring with us to Bunny Island imageslima4jpg HangOut This allvegan bar was so good that we came back twice San Francisco really needs a vegan bar The things I loved about this bar were that the food tasted better than bar food in the states for instance I ordered an amazing salad both times with watermelon radish and roasted kabocha squash the employees spoke english the menu was in English and the menu had pictures so you knew what to expect imageshanguotjpg Gyozas imageshangout2jpg The Bloody Mary didnt have a garnish but at least I was able to order one at night Vegan Bloody Mary at the Hangout in

purse since oftentimes the train station bathrooms didnt have soap or hand dryers imagesTsTantan3jpg Ts was probably the most affordable vegan place I found in Tokyo so I ate here like 5 times My first time was breakfast Heres a video of me periscoping the inside of the restauranthttpsyoutube6JK8gVdKCoM I ordered the shoyu ramen almost every time It was just so delicious and perfectly filling If you go for breakfast you can add a coffee for 100 yen around 1 imagesTsTantan1jpg Across the hall and to the left is a bakery Boulangerie La Terre They offer between 2 and 5 sweet and savory vegan options each day Its all in Japanese so you have to be able to communicate with the staff By the end of my trip I knew the words for butter milk eggs meat and fish but Ive forgotten them all already

make a delectable gum What he seemed to like the most about the TreeHugger bubble gum is that the flavors werent simple He feels like most bubble gum has very simple flavors and just a lot of sugar I liked the flavors too They start to wear off after about 10 minutes but theres still a slight hint of flavor that remains Test 2 Bubble blowing The gumballs come in the 2 sizes that we are accustom to gumballs being small and large We were able to blow small bubbles with around 34 of the small gumballs but had to chew around 56 to get the large sized bubbles you see here blowing a bubbleimagesbubblegum3jpg Test 3 Nutritional value This is my favorite part These are made with only natural colors but they still look so pretty TreeHugger vegan gumballsimagesbubblegum5jpg There are no artificial flavors or ingredients that I cant pronounce Its also glutenfree which Im sure is a plus for a lot of families but doesnt really apply to ours I hope one of the stores in SF sells the

take a bath in my jacuzzi tub while enjoying a fire However the official dollhousewarming was this past weekend when 30 of the best people I know came and visited and shared in my excitement And it wouldnt have been a complete housewarming weekend if we hadnt had our inaugural movie night tonight by watching The Addams Family on the big screen that just happens to retract into the ceiling when not in use so we arent tempted to watch movies when we should be doing more productive things on a nightly basis The dollhousewarming preparations started on Friday night when Ashley came over after

rather had an ice cream sundae with no cherry than use one of those super cute yet confidently bad for me maraschino cherries Luckily now I dont have to choose to live without something awesome Tillen Farms makes a wide variety of food and drink garnishes that are all vegan I predict they are marketing towards the fancy cocktail market but there is such a nice variety of cherries that can garnish a wide variety of food items that I needed to make the world aware of these I can see some amazing black forest cakes and milkshakes with whipped cream and cherries in the vegan future The cherries come in 4 colorsflavors Tillen Farms maraschino cherriesimagestillenfarms1jpg The tickled pink are definitely the cutest You would never guess that these are allnatural but they are My next favorite are the merry maraschino These are a nice bright red Bada bing are the traditional dark red bing cherry color that weve come to love and the rainier reserve are made from rainier cherries so they have

sacrificing my precious kitchen space for little reason If you dont already have this cookie bowl making pan made by Wilton you can probably drape your cookie dough over the back of a cupcake or

Baconimagesbaconjpg I guess this Sweet Earth vegan bacon has been out for awhile but Ive never seen it at my Whole Foods and I very rarely go to Target which is apparently the one store that carries all of their products At the expo booth they were serving virgin bloody marys with this bacon as the garnish so I will of course be doing this at home soon Its really yummy and it doesnt have a consistency similar to bacon at all which is what I love about it It reminds me of the Morning Star bacon I used to buy before I went vegan So good I wish it were organic but otherwise the ingredients are pretty healthy I only wish that Sweet Earth was an allvegan company I hate label reading Beyond Meatimagesbeyondmeat3jpg Beyong Meat for sure had the most clever booth with their mock McDonalds I dont know whos in charge of their marketing over there but Id like to meet them Brilliant They even gave out cute little happy meal toys to those waiting in line Beyond Meatimagesbeyondmeat1jpg Beyond Meatimagesbeyondmeat2jpg They gave out a little hamburger and some chicken sticks The hamburger tasted way too real for my liking but I heard some omnivores talking about how it was good but didnt taste authentic enough Shows what I know The breading on the chicken tenders was thicker than the ones on gardein chicken nuggets maybe because it was glutenfree so I wasnt a huge fan of those either I guess I just love plain chicken strips from this company so I can bread them and fry them myself at home Calafiaimagescalafia1jpg Ive been a fan of calafia since they first came onto the market with their almond milk Then my interest waned when the consistency of their milk changed to be thicker than I prefer But then they came out with their almond milk creamers which I love I nowwwwww this Triple shot cold brew bottled coffees I cannot wait for these I havent had a bottled vegan readytodrink coffee beverage that Ive liked until now The mexican mocha flavor was sooooooo gooooood Field Roast ChaoimagesChao1jpg Colormateimagescolormate1jpg Colormateimagescolormate2jpg Ive been on the hunt for natural vegan food dyes for basically ever good bright onesnot those stupid India Tree ones that just make everything look like different shades of brown I saw this company in Republic of V awhile back and when I went back to buy it they didnt carry it anymore So you can imagine how excited I was to see the Color Garden booth They even had cookies and a cake that they had decorated using the coloring so you could see what it actually looks like I got a sample that I be testing out soon and reviewing on here hopefully So excited Daiya Alfredo Mac n Cheeseimagesdaiyamacncheesejpg Daiya is coming out with 3 flavors of mac n cheese The 2 cheddar flavors arent good But this alfredo flavor is delicious enough for all 3 of them Daiya Alfredo Mac n Cheeseimagesdaiyamacncheese2jpg Daiya Supreme Pizzaimagesdaiya1jpg The new Supreme Pizza was my favorite of the 3 new pizza flavors They formed a partnership with beyond meat to make a sausage pizza that seriously reminds me so much of the Zpizza vegan pizza with the topping they call veggie burger crumbles Daiya Supreme Pizzaimagesdaiya2jpg Newest Daiya Pizza with white sauceimagesdaiya3jpg Daiya chocolate cheesecakeimagesdaiya4jpg I was already prepared for what these Daiya cheesecakes would taste like because Ive made a cheesecake using Daiya creamcheese by following the recipe on their website Im not a fan It just doesnt taste the kind Im used to because theyre nobake cheesecakes I like the baked ones However the amount of cacao in this chocolate flavored one was just enough bitterness to counterbalance the flavor of the daiya creamcheese that I dont care for so I actually thought the chocolate cheesecake was good I didnt taste the key lime one but I heard it was good as well which makes sense because lime is an overpowering flavor as well Follow Your HeartimagesFollowYourHeart1jpg imagesFollowYourHeart2jpg The Follow Your Heart booth was so adorable Follow Your HeartimagesFollowYourHeart3jpg These new cheeses they came out with are super yummy Theyre way better than the other follow your heart cheeses and definitely on par with Chao Cheese Follow Your HeartimagesFollowYourHeart4jpg Look how cute these little baby lunch box size ones are Gardeinimagesgardein1jpg Im a weird pickypants when it comes to mock seafood so I didnt think I would like these Gardein crab cakes but I was wrong Very wrong And the guys at the Gardein booth were super nice and helpful and told me about the restaurant we ended up having dinner at that night since I had never been there before If you havent been to Healthy Junk in Anaheim I highly recommend it Gardein Fish Filletsimagesgardein2jpg Again Gardein impressed me with their fish sticks Although I did hear some others saying that when they bake them according to instructions on the package they never taste as good I guess I just need a Gardein employee to come home with me and feed me Justinsimagesjustins1jpg I know we all love Justins PB cups so of course a cuter mini version of them made me fall even

everyone knows how old I am Secrets out imagesRebelKitchen2jpg Stacey Momimagesstaceymomjpg These dinners were yummy but the chick who worked the booth either hated me or hated her life She was not

didnt argue with her I just moved on Steves ice creamimagesSteves2jpg Steves I was so happy that they were there Im seriously a psycho fan of this stuff Ive been a regular consumer of the chocolate

imagine my glee when I saw this at their booth I almost couldnt contain my excitement so instead of exploding I politely read psychoticly informed the booth attendent that I basically already invented this flavor when I made ice cream cookie sandwiches on national ice cream sandwich day with the speculoos cookies and Steves cinnamon cold brew coffee ice cream They didnt have security escort me out

didnt care for was the chickn salad which is why theres no picture of it TofurkyimagesTofurkey3jpg However this tandoori chickn was crazy good And I dont even usually care for Indian food so they did a great job with this one TofurkyimagesTofurkey1jpg TruJoyimagesTruJoyjpg TruJoy vegan starbursts were at the Surf Sweets booth Are they the same company They must be Not everything they have is vegan

similar to the Chao and the new Follow Your Heart cheese Some vegan food blogger speculate that all three companies are partnering with the same manufacturer in Europe which is why theyre all so

I have actually been to a high tea was at the Stanford Inn They offer an allvegan high tea every day for their overnight guests and its divine They give you a choice of coconut or soy creamer for your tea and I have only been once but I would love to go again Theyre also doggie friendly if you have a pooch in your life who you would like to invite to high tea Even though I noticed that every hotel we stayed at in London had a tea station set up in every room I would never have thought to go to high tea while visiting there It wasnt until I saw Ashleys instagram post from her afternoon tea at The Savoy that I even realized it was a possibility to have vegan afternoon tea in London So I started doing some research to see if there were other places to have vegan afternoon tea as well While none of these are strictly vegan places they all offer a vegan tea option Here is a quick synopsis of what I discovered Im ordering this list by the ones that looked the best to the least attractive Le Chandelier in Dulwich 18person but outside of London 30 minutes by car 60 minutes by bus The Promenade at the Dorchester 45person vegan menu options include the following Sandwichesnbsp Rocket

VeganLukehttpveganlukecompost74929279882veganafternoonteacoworthparkinascotmy Connaught 41person So after staying up until 3am doing all this research Im not so good at adjusting to new time zones when traveling in the end I decided not to participate in high tea while visiting London Here is some of the supporting evidence in my decision I was already feeling like 45person for tea time was a bit steep until I used my currency calculator to determine that 45 pounds is actually 75 dollars For one person And the pastries arent even garnished with gold Theres a lot of controversy on the internet about whether or not vegans should support these places by giving them our hardearned money While its great that they cater to vegans and glutenfree diets they also serve Foie Gras on their menus As someone who experiences cross contamination issues about 25 of the time when dining at omnivore establishments I tend to opt for allvegan places whenever possible So the next 5 days in London will probably consist of me mentally and quite possibly in blog format as well converting all my purchases into how they compare to a vegan afternoon tea or portion thereof Since Im not yet in London and still waiting patiently at the boarding gate I will begin this comparison by using the 75 pounds that I saved to go back to the Stanford Inn look at llamas enjoy their complimentary vegan tea and

you have wisdom teeth extracted","href":"/blog/wisdom-tooth-weekend","content":"nbspListening to Wisdom Tooth Weekend by Sicko You like me and probably 99 of the US population probably got your wisdom teeth taken out when you were around 18 years old My boyfriend grew up in Spain and apparently in Spain they live by a motto thats something similar to if it aint broke dont fix it Or maybe Im thinking of the south Regardless he got his wisdom teeth taken out today at the abnormal age of 34 There are all these rules about what hes allowed to eat when so I thought I might as well document it for any other vegans who have to undergo this experience and are in need of a cheat sheet Day 1 Right after the extraction youre not allowed to eat anything for about 4 hours You cant even really drink water because your mouth is stuffed with gauze and you look like a chipmunk Chipmunkimageswisdomtoothweekend1jpg Once the anesthesia wears off you should start taking your medications that your dentist prescribed with ice water In day one cold drinks are the best thing for you You shouldnt have anything hot or even warm After a glass of ice water and a pain pill the bleeding should be almost stopped At this point if you dont want to look like the cute little chipmunk that you are you can wrap an ice pack in a kitchen towel and hold it onto your cheeks for 20 minutes on and 20 minutes off to help bring down the swelling Meal 1 Chocolate Peanut Butter Milkshake 2 frozen bananas 2 tablespoons cocoa powder 3 tablespoons peanut butter teaspoon vanilla extract 1 scoop chocolate protein powder I use Vega cup soymilk Directions Blend the ingredients together until there are no more chunks of banana Snack 1 Guacamole I didnt make this from scratch but you can I bought organic guacamole from Costco a few days before the surgery Instead of having it with chips you just eat bites of it from a spoon Yum Meal 2 Tomato Soup 1 can organic tomato sauce 1 can unsweetened nondairy milk teaspoon onion powder teaspoon garlic powder teaspoon pepper teaspoon salt tomato soup ingredientsimageswisdomtoothweekend3jpg Tomato Soup directions Whisk the ingredients together If the milk came out the fridge you should heat it on low until its room temperature making vegan tomato soupimageswisdomtoothweekend2jpg Meal 3 Chocolate Pudding cup organic sugar cup cocoa powder cup organic cornstarch teaspoon salt 3 cups organic soymilk 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Chocolate Pudding directions Whisk the dry ingredients together Add the milk slowly while whisking until its completely mixed Heat in a medium saucepan over medium heat whisking every minute or two Whisk continuously for 23 minutes as soon as it starts to bubble and thicken Remove from heat pour into glasses and chill all day or overnight in the fridge vegan chocolate puddingimageswisdomtoothweekend4jpg Day 2 Meal 1 Yogurt Thank you Wholesoy for making yogurt again because trying to come up with this many soupy food ideas on my own is difficult and quite honestly I hate the taste of every other vegan yogurt sold in this country Make sure you dont eat berryflavored yogurt because any tiny seeds could get caught in the gaping holes where your teeth used to be Meal 2 Organic Tomato Juice I havent been listing all the drinks here but weve been having ice water cold juice and chilled coconut water between meals The reason Im listing this one as a meal is because tomato juice is so thick and filling that I think it sort of counts as a meal organic knudsen tomato juiceimageswisdomtoothweekend8jpg Snack 1 Cold Brew Coffee This is the first time youre allowed to have coffee Yay After the surgery you have to wait 24 hours before consuming alcohol or caffeine Since all beverages you consume are supposed to be cold today were having our coffee in the form of cold brew If you arent familiar with cold brew its a healthier way to consume coffee has a milder taste and has more caffeine Since the caffeine content is higher you dont want to drink a glass of it Its concentrated I usually mix mine with vanilla coconut coffee creamer and soymilk cold brew ingredientsimageswisdomtoothweekend9jpg 2 glasses cold brew coffeeimageswisdomtoothweekend13jpg You probably think the one with the whipped cream on top is for the one recovering from oral surgery but youd be wrong That one is for meeeeeee Meal 3 Jello There are many different varieties of packaged vegan jello on the market some of them better than others Jello is so easy to make whether you have a package or are just using juice and agar agar This one sets really well but it uses xylitol as the sweetener which Im not a big fan of so I probably wont buy it again simply delish jelloimageswisdomtoothweekend5jpg vegan jelloimageswisdomtoothweekend6jpg Meal 4 Carrot Ginger Miso Soup Saut a diced onion 4 cloves of diced garlic and 2 pounds of thinly sliced carrots in a few tablespoons of olive oil Once the onion is translucent add enough water to cover the carrots a heaping tablespoon of miso and some bouillon Cook on low for a few hours and then use an immersion blender to pure it enough for the recovering patient to be able to eat it If you dont have a handheld blender you can use a regular blender but youll have to blend it in a few batches Make sure you let it cool a lot before the wisdomtoothless consumes it carrot miso ginger soupimageswisdomtoothweekend14jpg Dessert Chocolate Salted Caramel Ice Cream by Steves Day 3 This is the first day you can actually start having real food They have to be soft foods though Meal 1 Tofu Scramble Make a really basic scramble Mince the onions in a food processor before sauting them to make sure your patient wont have difficulty trying to chew anything too big Meal 2 Raw Tiramisu I made up a recipe loosely based on the live love eat rawhttpliveloveeatrawcomaurawvegantiramisunbsprecipe It has a lot of nuts in it so its filling but soft enough to eat on day 3 Raw tiramisuimageswisdomtoothweekend17jpg Meal 3 Mashed potatoes and carrots Sorry I didnt get any pictures of this but it was just the same as making mashed potatoes but I boiled carrots with the potatoes to make it more healthy On day 3 pretty much anything mashed is okay I even left the skins on the potatoes and he had no difficulty eating it Day 4 Meal 1 Fried apples My stepmom brought over some apples but since apples are too crunchy I decided to soften them by cooking them I just cut about 4 apples into cubes and put them in a saucepan with about a half cup water I sprinkled a teaspoon of cinnamon over them and cooked them on lowmedium until the water was gone Meal 2 Hummus Crackers chips and raw veggies are too crunchy so hummus by the spoonful is the best way to consume it right now If you dont have time to plan out your wisdom tooth shopping in advance then you can make your own hummus fairly easily at home if you have a blender or food processor Just use chickpeas tahini lemon juice I didnt have any lemons so I used lime juice and it was fine and garlic salt or salt garlic powder hummus ingredientsimageswisdomtoothweekend7jpg Meal 3 Starfishy cakes These are made with kasha and roasted red peppers At this point the wisdom toothless can basically eat anything thats not too crunchy All cooked grains pastas beans and veggies should be fine Just stay clear from chips raw veggies crackers and basically anything crispy crunchy or that requires a lot of chewing for the next week or two Starfishy cakesimageswisdomtoothweekend16jpg Dont forget to put your teeth under your pillow for the tooth fairy unless your dentist is selfish and keeps your teeth for himself like Davids dentist

Fried caper garnish is highly recommended.","href":"/recipes/vegan-chickpea-hearts","content":"When we were in Las Vegas in SeptemberOctober Davids birthday dinner was at an italian restaurant at the Wynn called Bartolotta One of the appetizers on the menu was a chickpea patty cut into triangles and served with a fried caper garnish It was soooo amazing that it made up for the fact that the boys had to go to the mall to buy shirts with collars because of the Wynn restaurants and their stupid ass dresscodes For a few weeks after that dinner I seriously just wanted to make a vat of fried capers and carry them around with me forevermore so I could add them to everything I eat I recovered from that stage and instead decided to try to replicate the recipe at home Chickpea Hearts Ingredients 1 c chickpea flour 15 c vegetable broth olive oil Chickpea Hearts Directions Make nbsp15 cups of vegetable broth or use packaged I used to buy the Rapunzel bouillonnbspcubes but it was so hard to get them to dissolve that now I buy this huge jar of vegan bouillonnbsppaste from Costco I highly recommend it because its way easier to work with and tastes delicious The only downside is that it takes up precious room in the fridge and if youre like me you likely dont have a square to spare Whisk in 1 cup of chickpea flour slowly Relax for an hour or so to give the mixture time to thicken Coat a baking pan with olive oil pour mixture into pan and bake at 350 for a half hour Remove from oven let cool for 5 minutes and cut into shapes with a knife or cookie cutters imageschickpea3sjpg Fried Capers Ingredients 14 12 c capers 4 T safflower or sunflower oil Fried Capers Directions Drain and dry the capers using a strainer and then sandwich them between paper towels Heat nbspthe 4 tablespoons of oil in a pan on mediumhigh while capers are drying The benefit of using safflower or sunflower oil over using olive oil is that those oils can withstand a higher heat before turning into transfats Olive oil is a lowheat oil Fry the capers until they start to change color 35 minutes Line a plate with many paper towels and place the capers there to absorb any extra oil
