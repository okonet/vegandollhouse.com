requested the same cupcakes that I had made the month before for Jessica39s birthday which were apparently a big hit however Josipa deserves a new recipe for her birthday because she39s the Cutest Croatian Cupie C3 doll in the world I was trying to decide what type of cupcake to make when I remembered a time forever ago forever approximately 6 years that Josipa and I tried to make tiramisu I say tried not because we didn39t succeed in creating the dessert but more because it was quite possibly the worst tiramisu in the history of tiramisu Josipa is an excellent cook and I39m not the worst cook in the world but somehow the Robinsipa combination failed I39m pretty confident that our failure was attributed to us both adding the required amount of baking soda therefore causing the entire dessert to taste like a baking soda cake Also we doubled the recipe so we were stuck with a ridiculous amount of this undesirable treat So I did what everyone does when they39re stuck with too much of a bad thing I brought it to work to pawn it off on my coworkers If time travel is ever possible I might use it to reverse that decision due to the relentless way my coworkers have teased me to this day Basically my takeaway from this and I hope it39s also a lesson learned vicariously through me for others reading this is that if you39re trying to sell people on veganism don39t introduce them to vegan food by feeding them something gross I had been forming an idea in my mind for a few days of how I wanted to make these cupcakes so I headed to Whole Foods and I coincidentally ran into the birthday girl in the banana aisle for ingredients where I was inspired by looking at their bakery case and seeing a tiramisu that was served in a cup made out of chocolate It totally reminded me of the scene in Willy Wonka where he sips the tea out of the daffodil and then bites the cup The only decision I hadn39t yet finalized is what type of cup to serve it in since I would be layering it So I decided to try to make chocolate cupcake wrappers out of melted vegan chocolate chips by using a silicone pastry brush to paint a thin layer of chocolate in the inside of my silicone cupcake wrappers they were very excited to be used twice in one day after a month or two of neglect I left them in the freezer overnight to form the perfect level of resistance to the abuse that the placement of the tiramisu layers was sure to cause Here39s the hard part taking them out of the silicone wrappers without damaging them I had a 810 survival rate due to a learning curve So unless you have already participated in this activity you should probably make more than you actually need since some will likely be casualties The secret to doing this I found is to take only one at a time from the freezer so the others don39t melt loosen the wrappers from the chocolate all the way around the perimeter and then turn the silicone wrapper inside out to get the chocolate cup to come out without breaking I made the cupcakes with a vanilla cupcake recipe subbing coffee and creamer for the milk traditionally used Once cooled cutting the cupcakes in half horizontally created 2 coffee cupcake layers The first layer is a dollop of chocolate mousse The second layer is cake The third layer is chocolate mousse The fourth layer is cake The last layer is cream cheese frosting The garnish is cocoa powder Here39s the birthday girl aka C3 with her cupcake "},{"title":"Halloween 2013","section":"blog","thumbnail":"/images/bats.jpg","date":"2013-11-03","href":"/blog/2013-11-03-halloween2013","content":" Halloween 2013 Every single one of the seven years I have worked at Empirical we have had a Halloween costume contest I personally love the idea even though I haven39t ever won because I like seeing my coworkers dressed up However this year I decided to use a google survey to ask my coworkers what they wanted to do for Halloween Not one single person voted for the conventional costume contest They39re over it They wanted something new The option receiving the most votes was to have a Halloweenthemed food contest Since Halloween is my favorite holiday and making themed food is my favorite way to cook I was really excited to come up with something cute cute is not another word for scaryI don39t like scary food So I decided to make bats and pumpkin hummus Luckily I had a photographerassistant during this process because making bat crackers actually takes a lot longer than one might expect It was as if I were genetically engineering real bats in my kitchen You can use any cracker recipe from the internet I made one up but I didn39t think it was actually that tasty so I won39t share it with you Once you roll the dough out as thinly as possible you use your batshaped cookie cutter to make as many bats as possible If you don39t dip the cutter in flour between each bat the bats will stick into the cookie cutter each time like this If that happens just push it out with your fingers Lay all your bats onto a baking stone If you don39t have a baking stone get one Until then just place the bats onto a cookie sheet that39s lined with parchment paper While they39re baking you can start cutting out your nori Place the cookie cutter on top of a sheet of nori on a cutting board Use an exacto knife to cut around the cookie cutter Once the crackers have cooled dip each nori bat into a bowl of nama shoyu soy sauce and then place on top of a cracker I didn39t get any pictures of this process because my photographer was busy cutting out bats but you basically just smooth it over the top of the cracker with your finger until it sticks and then set the bat onto a cooling rack to dry Here is a picture of the crackers and dip at my work lunch along with some of the other Halloweenthemed vegan foods that my coworkers made The hummus wasn39t actually pumpkin flavored I used carrot juice to make it orange and served it in a hallowedout pumpkin

goes through at some point in their life except for me because I think it may have been born when I was into punk rock music and thought I was too tough to like cute little kid stuff Zen and Isabelle went through a pokemon stage a few years ago and like most stages it faded away and the Phamphey and Piplup jackets I made them went unworn Then all of a sudden after I had basically forgotten what the word pokemon meant they came back to lifelike little cute supernatural zombie creatures Now all I hear about is charmander and houdour and celebi So it wasn39t a huge surprise when I asked what kind of cupcakes Isabelle and Ashleigh wanted for their 12th birthday dance party and they said the theme was pokemon Since they didn39t mind what flavor the cupcakes were I made chocolate cupcakes with vanillaalmond icing Isabelle had this black decorating icing leftover from her super cute Halloween Jack Skellington cupcakes that happens to be vegan by default but not good for you so use it sparingly The first step of making pokeballs is to make a premier ball If you have any pokemon fans in your life you may have been told what a premier ball is If your attention span all of a sudden reduces from 1 hour to 23 seconds when someone starts talking about pokemon like mine does then you probably don39t remember what the difference between a regular pokeball and a premier ball is I left one of the pokeballs as a premier ball because one of Isabelle and Ashleigh39s friends doesn39t eat red food coloring so she got a special premier ball at the party You can buy red sugar from the store I didn39t I like my organic raw unbleached sugar so I made my own red sugar If you don39t have a mortar and pestle you can just use a spoon and a bowl I applied the red sugar to the pokeballs by spooning on spoonfuls while tilting the cupcakes over the bowl Here are the birthday girls with their cupcakes "},{"title":"Sweet Potato Biscuit Thanksgiving

Sandwich I used to hate Thansgiving I thought it was a day that celebrated an upsetting time in history by slaughtering millions of turkeys However I have now come to see that Thanksgiving is actually a day to celebrate 4 days off of work quality time with family and friends which apparently is now called friendsgiving although I just discovered this yesterday so the PIC people in charge must have forgotten to send me the email informing me of the change and a bountiful harvest The only harvest I actually participated in this year were some really cute pale green pattypan squash and a plethora of late blooming heirloom tomatoes However since farmer39s market is only 2 blocks away I39m celebrating all the yumminess that my local farmers harvested this year One of my favorite parts about Thanksgiving is that there are so many leftovers that I get to eat thanksgiving sandwiches for every single meal over the postthansgiving week Jessica suggested we call these breakfastlunchdinner sandwiches since I literally have now eaten them for all of those meals today I39m pretty confident that anyone old enough to know how to use a computer already knows how to make a sandwich but I39ll

Dollhouses","section":"blog","thumbnail":"/images/neighborhood.jpg","date":"2013-12-27","href":"/blog/2013-12-27-gingerbread-dollhouses","content":" Gingerbread Dollhouses While I was growing up most people said that the best holiday was Christmas I can only assume that the reason for this blatant LIE was the copious amounts of presents that children would receive on this particular occasion as opposed to the infiltration of holidaythemed songs in every public location during the entire month or the abundance of fruitcakequite possibly the worst dessert ever invented Although I don39t actually celebrate Christmas I do think that the holiday has a few redeeming qualities One is mistletoe because well who wouldn39t love a parasite that encourages random make outs But my favoritest thing about Christmas is decorating gingerbread houses Michael39s craft store actually sells a veganbydefault gingerbread house kit which I took advantage of last year since they went on sale for 99 cent just before New Years However I didn39t actually want to eat it after enjoying its beauty for a few weeks because although it was vegan it definitely wasn39t organic and probably wasn39t very delicious either Earlier this year I was browsing a website filled with 3D printer blueprints deciding on what fun things I could ask David to print for me when I found this I39m not sure who to credit for this brilliant idea spindledev but I39m pretty sure they had my thingsRobinwouldwishforifsheknewtheyexisted list in their possession when inventing it I39ve been slowly transitioning my beliefs mainly after years of hanging out with Pamela that everything is cuter when it39s been minified except for dogs so naturally I couldn39t wait to make these I knew I had to at least wait until December but in order to pass the time more quickly I gave myself an appetizer task of making invitations to send to friends in hopes that they might like to join in on the gingerbread dollhouse decorating as well I used a recipe from the PETA website to make the gingerbread and the glue icing Here are all the walls ready to go into the oven pictured with the cookie cutter from the 3D printer And here they are after coming out of the oven The 3D printer blueprint only produced a cookie cutter for one of the 3 pieces needed for this project so I had to improvise with paper templates for the other 2 If I hadn39t been on a deadline and was smarter then this method might have worked However I wasn39t using my skills learned in woodshop class and therefore there may have been a requirement for the gingerbread house construction workers to partake in some slight nibbling of 2 of the 4 walls while building their dollhouses Nobody seemed to mind this task with the exception of Josipa who seemed to think her nibblingstopping willpower didn39t stand a chance against the deliciousness of the gingerbread We were all very proud of her for stopping before hers turned into a 2D gingerbread house and for being the first builderette to produce a completed house Her superior construction skills were no surprise since she39s the only one who actually owns a house and power tools and builds things trellises raised garden beds etc Somehow Jessica jessicaspacekat managed to take a lot of these pictures although I may have also stolen a few from Instagram while simultaneously making a super cute heartshingled gingerbread mughouse Here39s what a mughouse looks like before it39s decorated The gingerbread dolls living in this mughouse probably thought they were undergoing some sort of a natural disaster but in actuality Jessica just likes to dunk her biscuits and cookies into tea before eating them I didn39t think she would appreciate me posting the picture I took of her biting into the dollhouse but it kinda reminded me of a sexier version of the rockbiter from neverending story Our other event photographer was Jocelyn Jocelyn jocelyntran was quite qualified for this job because she has experience in taking pictures of food for her food blog She started off by showing you all the vegan decorations we were able to find for decorating these mini gingerbread houses All these wilton brand glitters and sparkles are vegan by default Everything made by BioVegan is amazing but you have to go to Berlin to buy them or get someone who likes you a lot to smuggle them back for you when they visit And here are some other random sprinkles that are vegan These wilton ones and the little black balls are the only sprinkles I can find by Wilton that are vegan If anyone knows of other tiny candies or sprinkles that are vegan that aren39t pictured here please send me links Luckily for me and Emily who were experiencing contruction catastrophes Jocelyn came up with the brilliant plan of decorating her roof pieces before attaching them to the house She39s so smart Although Emily39s first house experienced an earthquake that registered 485760843085 on the Richter scale her perserverance paid off She learned some new tricks on roof construction before building her second house and it came out beautifully Not to our surprise her gingerbread house was the dollhouse version of her very own hearts club cabin Another resident of the hearts club cabin not only volunteered her adorable home for this activity but she also decorated a cute mini gingerbread sidecar house while being an amazing hostess even though she may have not so secretly wanted to be in bed Somehow Jenn managed to escape the cameras and phones for the entirety of the day so hers will not be displayed individually but she made some amazing vegan brownies with walnuts to make up for it We had a visit by yet another Jessica jlsuttles because one Jessica is never really enough is it Not only did she make the only burtonesque gingerbread dollhouse but she also made the best looking and most structurally sound one I was shocked at how amazing her mini gingerbread house looked and held up considering she has never made one before gothic or otherwise If there had been prizes at this event she would have gone home with more than just her gingerbread dollhouse We thought she might be done but why be done when you can add mooooooore blaaaack Jessica was also accompanied by the lovely Justine who came all the way to SF from Ohio just to make her very first gingerbread house There39s a possibility she may have been visiting for other reasons as well but let39s be honest when you make it to adulthood without ever having made a gingerbread house do any other reasons even count Here39s a quick overview of the construction process of one of these cute little homes You start with 4 walls and 2 roof pieces Then you glue the walls together I advise cutting the smallest hole you can possibly cut in the icing glue baggie without the use of a magnifying glass Wearing tights that match the rug isn39t a requirement Here is what it might look like once built but not yet decorated To decorate just add icing glue to any spot where you want to glue decorations Here is the majority of the construction crew featured with our vegan gingerbread dollhouse sidecar mughouse neighborhood

wedges so after about 5 of those concerns of nutrients tend to become less prominent I made half the jello from a box and the other half from scratch using agar I highly recommend only making it from scratch It came out way better Sidenote one of the snacks we had was those chocolate covered sea salted almonds from TJ If you haven39t had these you MUST get some They are ridiculously delicious and

either way Step 3 Add a tofu patty I made these by squeezing the water out of a block of tofu and blending the tofu with a bunch of spices cumin turmeric nutritional yeast salt pepper garlic powder Then spoon the blended tofu into a mold cookie cutter of some sort that you set onto a baking stone or cookie sheet When you lift the cookie cutter the tofu will hold its shape You can also just make dollops and flatten them to around a half an inch in thickness I baked these tofu patties at 350 for 20 minutes then sprinkled cheese on top and broiled until the cheese melted Step 4 Add cooked

Break London Day 1 If you travel by Ryan Air youll find yourself arriving in STN which is an hour outside of London If you arrive at midnight like I did you may opt to stay the night at one of the airport hotels and head to London in the morning In addition to the benefit of going to sleep sooner the hotels by the airport are also cheaper than the ones in London I chose the Radisson Blu because hotelscom had a room with free wifi and breakfast After chatting with a local on the airport escalator and determining that Londoners don39t drink the tap water my first purchase upon arriving to the UK was a bottle of water from the hotel bar that cost the equivalent of 750 It was bottled on an organic farm in Wales but for 750 I39m picturing it being bottled by baby lambs which makes me feel okay about the cost Normally I assume that Ill be lucky to find an apple some orange juice and a bowl of oatmeal when American hotels offer free breakfast but this was more like dining with a royal family compared to that They had a ridiculous buffet of every breakfast item you could imagine but even more because it was a traditional english breakfast so add fried tomatoes sauteed mushrooms baked beans etc There were a surprising number of vegan options and they even had raw sugar and soy milk for the cereal and coffee After a 45 minute train ride with a beautiful view of the countryside along the way the next stop was to check in to our new hotel The Wesley and head to Camden Town There may have been 2 unsuccessful attempts to rent bikes Sheep seemed to have zero problems doing it last time before deciding to walk I feel so lucky that the weather is gorgeous and sunny with no rain during my stay Last time I visited I remembering it being much colder and somewhat wetter The only vegan restaurant I could find that served a traditional english breakfast on a Thursday was inSpiral Lounge but I do not recommend it They were out of sausage and told us they would sub bacon but instead they subbed eggplant The tofu scramble and sauteed mushrooms were good but the rest wasn39t worth a damnespecially not for 15 The baked beans tasted like they mixed a can of navy beans with a can of tomato sauce In addition to the mediocre food a number of other factors turned me against inSpiral Lounge which include but are not limited to their inability to run my credit card their nonexistent wifi that they claim to have and an extremely difficult secret password written in invisible ink process of using the loo After leaving inSpiral I knew only one thing could make me feel betterCookies and Scream Last time I was in London 2 years ago I tried to go here for an espresso milkshake but they were closing by the time I got there so I had to order something else I39ve been waiting this entire time for the espresso shake and it did not disappoint We may have also ordered a mint brownie to take back to the hotel for later Can you blame us Just look at them You39d think after all of that the pigginess would end but nooooo We stopped at the Holland amp Barret health food store in Camden Town to check out their vegan section I wish our hotel room had a fridge so I could have bought one of everything but instead I only bought some cheezly to eat with crackers in the hotel I39ll have to eat it all really fast since there39s no fridgelife is so hard I wanted to get the cheddar but David is more of a risk taker than I am so he talked me into trying the edam kind I don39t even know what it is so I39ll report back once I taste it Also what39s up with Tofutti playing favourites They don39t make these flavors of cream cheese for us Nor do they make cute little single serving sized packages for us I don39t know about you but I never manage to get through an entire package of cream cheese so these little baby sized ones would be perfect for me I could take them to work travel with them hide them for easter would that be weird the list goes on Who wants to help me write some letters to Tofutti Manna was my favorite vegan restaurant in London They claim to be the oldest vegetarian restaurant in the city so it must be their years of experience that has made them so awesome I ordered the bangers and mash since it39s supposed to be London39s specialty like ordering curryworst when you39re in Berlin It consisted of a layer of mashed potatoes topped with a layer of gravymarinated kale topped with 2 delicious housemade sausages and to my surprise and happiness was topped with onion rings All of this floated in a sea of gravy I loved it The mashed potatoes were made with dill which gave them a potatosaladlike taste that was quite refreshing The coating on the onion rings was much lighter than the veggie grill onion rings making them seem a bit closer to a tempura onion ring The sausage was divine The flavor was perfect with just the right amount of sage and the consistency didn39t taste like meat so it was great for someone who doesn39t like eating mock sausage that has that gristly substance to it David ordered the polenta which looked so pretty on the plate due to the addition of beets and kale For dessert I was excited to see petite fours on the menu I39ve only had vegan petite fours once before which is when Jessica and Pamela made them for my birthday tea party I39ve seen them often when having tea with nonvegans so I39ve come to have an expectation of what they should look like I will admit that I was slightly disappointed when the petite fours arrived to our table and looked like this However they were still delicious the next day when we ate them with tea in our hotel room The other aspect of Manna that made it so awesome other than the amazing food was the decor They had this really cute wallpaper with birdies hanging out in trees and the ceiling lights were made to look like tree branches Day 1 came to a close with one last tube ride back to the hotel I felt like I spent 25 of Day 1 on the underground My synopsis of the tube is that it smells better than the metro in NYC but it still has a weird underground basement smell that I39m not fond of We decided that for the rest of the London vegan adventure we would try to stay above ground as much as possible "},{"title":"Vegan tea time in

had a couple in my backyard one in a park and have visited a few tea houses Darteeling Crown amp Crumpet and Petunia39s in San Francisco and Portland I love how all the food is cute The only time I have actually been to a high tea was at the Stanford Inn They offer an allvegan high tea every day for their overnight guests and its divine They give you a choice of coconut or soy creamer for your tea and I have only been once but I would love to go again Theyre also doggie friendly if you have a pooch in your life who you would like to invite to high tea Even though I noticed that every hotel we stayed at in London had a tea station set up in every room I would never have thought to go to high tea while visiting there It wasnt until I saw Ashleys instagram post from her afternoon tea at The Savoy that I even realized it was a possibility to have vegan afternoon tea in London So I started doing some research to see if there were other places to have vegan afternoon tea as well While none of these are strictly vegan places they all offer a vegan tea option Here is a quick synopsis of what I discovered Im ordering this list by the ones that looked the best to the least attractive Le Chandelier in Dulwich 18person but outside of London 30 minutes by car 60 minutes by bus The Promenade at the Dorchester 45person vegan menu options include the following Sandwiches Rocket salad and hummus Grilled Mediterranean vegetables Cucumber and cress Pastries Fruit salad Dark chocolate mousse Vegan Carrot cake Orange jelly with raspberry Flemings Mayfair London 25person Claridges 50person Palm Court at The Langham 38person for unlimited sandwiches cakes and tea refills Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon at Fortnum amp Mason 44person and the vegan menu is online Lanesborough hotel They were closed for renovations in April 2014 so I wasnt able to find out how much they charge The Savoy Hotel 45person below is a picture of their dessert taken by ashleythevegan Coworth Park in Ascot I didnt inquire as to the cost of this one because it was so very far outside of London but I did see a delicious looking picture posted by VeganLuke Connaught 41person So after staying up until 3am doing all this research Im not so good at adjusting to new time zones when traveling in the end I decided not to participate in high tea while visiting London Here is some of the supporting evidence in my decision I was already feeling like 45person for tea time was a bit steep until I used my currency calculator to determine that 45 pounds is actually 75 dollars For one person And the pastries arent even garnished with gold Theres a lot of controversy on the internet about whether or not vegans should support these places by giving them our hardearned money While its great that they cater to vegans and glutenfree diets they also serve Foie Gras on their menus As someone who experiences cross contamination issues about 25 of the time when dining at omnivore establishments I tend to opt for allvegan places whenever possible So the next 5 days in London will probably consist of me mentally and quite possibly in blog format as well converting all my purchases into how they compare to a vegan afternoon tea or portion thereof Since Im not yet in London and still waiting patiently at the boarding gate I will begin this comparison by using the 75 pounds that I saved to go back to the Stanford Inn look at llamas enjoy their complimentary vegan tea and order a vegan white russian during their happy hour "},{"title":"Spring Break: London (Day 2)","section":"blog","thumbnail":"/images/Vx.jpg","date":"2014-04-16","href":"/blog/2014-04-16-spring-break-london-day-2","content":" Spring Break London Day 2 Day 2 of the London Vegan Adventure began with a complimentary breakfast at the Wesley Hotel Similar to the Radisson39s breakfast this was an extravagant traditional english breakfast Since the chef was actually cooking right there out in the open I was able to ask him what items were vegan and I ended up being able to eat a pretty decent variety They also had soy milk and organic sugar for the coffee Also is it just me or does all the coffee in London taste watered down When I was in Spain it all tasted twice as strong and in London it all tasted half as strong Is this a geographic preference I wonder what people from other countries think of San Francisco coffee As they say the third time is a charm We finally found a bike station that we could figure out how to obtain bikes from So we rode to Oxford Street returned the bikes and walked around shopping and people watching I got a bag full of stuff from Primark since the last time I was in London I found some really awesome stuff I got a really cute tote bag with unicorns and stars all over it as well as a lot of tights for myself and friends Then I visited what I believe to be the equivalent to our Starbucks called Pret Managre only it39s superior to Starbucks because it39s organic I enjoyed a latte with the mint brownie from Cookies N Scream In a record store I saw that London has a dance night called Blow Up too I don39t actually know if SF still has theirs since I haven39t been in years but the one in London actually looks better Too bad I was so sleepy on Saturday night that I opted out of going Beetroot is either vegetarian or vegan and kind of reminded me of a mall food court Loving Hut in that they have a bunch of already hot food bar items that you can order take out from but they also make smoothies and fresh juices I ordered the Beatnik juice since it was the only one with beets in it and I figure if I39m at a place called Beetroot I should probably be drinking beetroot juice There was a clothing store called Monki that had the cutest decor that I had to go inside Too bad the clothes weren39t cute at all But look at this adorableness that housed the inferiorly aesthetic clothing After another successful bicycle transport we arrived at Regent39s Park where they had rows of cherry blossom trees as far as the eye could see The cheese and cracker picnic would have been better if the crackers didn39t taste like styrofoam but I counterbalanced that problem by increasing the cheezly to cracker ratio to 8020 There39s a portion of Regent39s park called Queen Elizabeth39s circle that is supposed to have something crazy like 20000 roses but of course they were all just rose branches in April so instead we found a mini waterfall Next stop was a vegan boutique that Ashley told me about called Vx It was super tiny but they had a good variety I bought some stuff that I didnt take pictures of and I tried to buy these adorable shoes but they didnt have them in my size Waaaahhhh They had some cheese there called Teezini that I really wanted to get but our hotel didnt have a fridge so I didnt get it lt3 I was crazy excited that they had vegan eclairs because the only time Ive ever had one was at Millennium so it was probably a million dollars for one Sadly however the filing tasted nothing like eclair filling so Im back to my mission to search the planet for a decent vegan eclair We met up with friends at a pub called Public Bar in Soho where they served Samuel Smiths All their beers were marked as vegan except 2 They even had a statement on their menu about how their brewery was the first one to register with the Vegan Society is that the same as the secret society of vegans that Ashley is now an honorary member of David ordered the chocolate stout which with an exception of the smell was barely a distant relative of chocolate Although I guess it tasted more like chocolate than that time Jessica convinced me to taste her beer that she insisted tasted like candy when we were at the Belgian bar in the Tenderloin in SF The girl sitting next to me had a really gorgeous purplish reddish drink which she told me was called a black cider Its apparently cider mixed with black currant juice How could I resist trying that It was delicious This picture isnt the best I blame Ernesto for showing the pretty color of this beverage but trust me that it looked as pretty as it tasted Mildred39s was only 2 doors down from Public Bar which was super convenient Mildreds almost always has a wait so if you decide to go there you should put your name on the list and then go to Public Bar for a black cider while you wait I ordered a drink called pornstar which had a half of a passion fruit floating it Sorry I didnt take a picture I think this could be the first time I have ever tried passion fruit fresh I didnt like the consistency of the seeds at all and considering that it doesnt have a square millimeter that is seedfree I think this may be the kind of fruit that I will only be enjoying in smoothies forevermore The appetizer was dumplings with this really yummy dipping sauce that I couldnt replicate or describe in any amount of articulation besides yummy My dinner was the mushroom pie which was a bunch of different kinds of mushrooms in a wine reduction sandwiched between 2 layers of crust made from phyllo dough It came with mashed peas sprinkled with dill delicious and a combination of mashed white and sweet potatoes Im not a huge fan of things cooked in wine so I probably wont order this again but it was still yummy and our server commented on how happy I looked so I must have been enjoying myself The end of Day 2 landed us at a bar called Borderline for a dance night called Bedrock In spite of the website describing it as Yeah Yeah Yeahs and LCD Soundsystem type music as well as the fact that Blanca recommended it as being fun it was the most broey nonfun dance night that I have visited in a long time Note to self When on vacation stick with pubs "},{"title":"Spring Break: London (Day 3)","section":"blog","thumbnail":"/images/Cakes-drinks.jpg","date":"2014-04-20","href":"/blog/2014-04-20-spring-break-london-day-3","content":" Spring Break London Day 3 If I die I hope I end up at Cakes N Treatsaka heaven if it were customized for Robins Things that make this place so amazing include the following Super cute and sweet staff I was so enamoured by the selection that I probably asked way too many questions that would have led any San Francisco cafe staff member to pierce my soul with a stare of hatred but here I got not only patience but I actually learned things For instance the sausage they serve with their English breakfast was so delicious that I had to ask what kind it was I learned all about how Paul McCartney yes of The Beatles has a vegetarian family and his daughter has a line of vegetarianvegan mock meats This of course led me on a journey to try to find the sausages to take back to Spain I may have also acquired some frozen sausages wrapped in pastry puff that were soooo goood Adorable decor This ranges from the doilyesque furniture to the tattoo font on the menu chalkboards to the flash art sheets in themes of cupcakes and sweets to the EVERYTHING For proof see the one million pictures I39m about to post below Allvegan menu By the name you might assume that they serve cake and tea They actually have so much more Of all the traditional English breakfasts I had while in London there were 4 this was by far my very favorite Their coffee menu was more extravagant than Starbucks I don39t mean this as an insult It actually reminded me of the flavor options at one of my favorite cafes in the US Grindcore House in Philly They had 4 milk options They also had vegan snickers bars Custom cakes While I39m not really a fan of fondant they had the cutest vegan cake that was themed after Corpse Bride As if they hadn39t already won me over Who has a teapot shaped chalkboard Seriously Mocha and Caramel Latte made with oat milk I know that going to a chain when you39re traveling is boring You should try to experience new places as a local However that being said going to chains to see the differences can be neat For instance Starbucks in Spain all have fresh squeezed orange juice I love that So I was excited to go to a Whole Foods in London to see what foods they had that were different It was basically ALL of them I was most excited by the vegan cheese section where I acquired some Vegusta to bring back to Spain It was a new kind I had never had before with herbs in it Here are some pictures I took of the rest of the cheeses that Whole Foods had My best find at Whole Foods was organic Hello Kitty pasta I wanted to buy 127649598 of them but luggage space is always an issue when traveling so I could only get 4 It might also have been because there were only 4 packages left on the shelf Tesco stores aren39t really anything special They39re kind of like the equivalent to Safeway in northern California or Ralph39s in southern California However we had to go there to find the sausages and they had a number of other cute andor yummy vegan things Itadaki Zen is an organic and vegan japanese restaurant It differs from ChaYa in that it seems more authentic This authenticity is not only obvious in the food options but also in the fact that there is a zen garden inside of the restaurant After leaving London and arriving in Zaragoza Spain I saw this sign in the airport I feel like this sign should just be posted everywhere all the time "},{"title":"Pressed Salad","section":"blog","thumbnail":"/images/pressed-salad.jpg","date":"2014-07-10","href":"/blog/2014-07-10-pressed-salad","content":" Pressed Salad Apparently the new craze in salad these days is pressed salad I hadn39t ever had one before making this one so it was kind of an experiment I39ve only been hearing about them for the past month or so From what I understand it39s sort of similar to the process of making sauerkraut so it has a lot of the same health benefits even though it only has about an hour to ferment I used to make sauerkraut before I worked so much I heard from someone who stayed at the hippocrates institute to combat cancer that they serve sauerkraut with every meal Once I found that out I started making it because cabbage is cheap but raw sauerkraut is usually quite pricey If you google the reasons why sauerkraut is good for you to eat regularly you39ll find more reasons than you39ll be able to read in a day They range from digestive aids to glowing skin to natural antibiotics to increased enzyme count to diminishing the craving for sweets and on and on and on Most pressed salad advocates talk about how they39re easier to digest than regular salad but that could be said for the chopped salad as well Remember the last salad fad The New York restaurants chopped up the salad ingredients so tiny that you didn39t even really know what was in your salad The upside though is that it would decrease the amount of work your body has to do with chewing and digesting So I guess the real question is when you39re pressing salad for only an hour is that even enough time for your salad to grow any probiotics Chi Energy says you can get probiotics from only 1015 minutes of pressing your salad What do you all think All you have to do to make this is chop up your salad ingredients massage them with salt like you do when you make kale salad and press into a glass or ceramic vessel traditionally sauerkraut is made in a crock but you can use anything in your kitchen really Top with another glass or ceramic dish and then top with something really heavy to push all the air out I used some little heart ceramic dishes I got from Daiso for only 150 each Once you have your pressed salad you just top with your favorite dressing I used lemon juice only but I think next time I39ll use gomasio and nutritional yeast as well "},{"title":"Vegan

I39ve been doing a fair fair hardly tolerable amount of complaining on here about how much moving sucks Now it39s finally time to stop complaining well not completely I mean I am me after all and start bragging Well bragging is such an icky word Let39s instead use the phrase talkingabouthowmuchbetterthenewdollhouseisthantheoldone In my mind the warming of the new dollhouse really started when Jessica came over and taught me how to use my fireplace and was the first to take a bath in my jacuzzi tub while enjoying a fire However the official dollhousewarming was this past weekend when 30 of the best people I know came and visited and shared in my excitement And it wouldn39t have been a complete housewarming weekend if we hadn39t had our inaugural movie night tonight by watching The Addams Family on the big screen that just happens to retract into the ceiling when not in use so we aren39t tempted to watch movies when we should be doing more productive things on a nightly basis The dollhousewarming preparations started on Friday night when Ashley came over after work to help make dollhouseshaped cookies She even stayed up past her bedtime until we were all finished because she39s such a trooper Thanks Jocelyn for having enough restraint to take this cute picture of your cookie before you ate it Saturday morning we made strawberry lemonade and strawberry lemonade sangria with heart shaped strawberries floating in the pitchers To garnish the drinks we had strawberries with umbrellas in them for placing on the edge of the glasses Mia said the party looked like a vegan etsy party so she coined the term vetsy to describe it In addition to the sangria David made bloody marys with cute garnishes too Bloody Marys are kind of his specialty He even makes his own vegan worcestershire from scratch I made taco bowls I didn39t really know how this would turn out due to the fact that I had never attempted this before and many years of supporting evidence that even when things turn out really cute in my head the execution isn39t always so exquisite This was probably the best party I39ve been to in over a year I love my friends and family Would it be weird to have a

Jessica then you know she39s the most adorable person that ever lived So when she asked for strawberry shortcake as her birthday dessert I immediately started brainstorming how I could make it as cute as her Okay that39s not possible but I at least had to try Strawberry shortcake has this connotation for me at least as being this hard biscuit with shapeless pieces of strawberries strewn about and a glob of whipped cream It39s not an attractive dessert The colors are nice but that almost always happens when you39re willing to sacrifice taste ahem chocolate for looks brown is just not a cute color pretty much ever So after a lot of brainstorming I finally narrowed it down to 3 possibilities Keep in mind this dessert will be served at a bar so it can39t be a big beautiful layered cake with perfect triangle slices on cute colored plates with bamboo utensils This isn39t that kind of birthday party It has to be a lowmaintenance easytosneakintosomewhereifneeded easytoconsume type of dessert So the 3 finalists 1 layered in small mason jars 2 A swirl roll but I39ll have to put it on a lollipop stick or skewer to keep it from being too messy to eat or 3 Bite sized strawberry shortcake hors d39oeuvres Okay while I know Jessica likes the swirl and would very much appreciate it I don39t think I want my first time experimenting with something difficult to be on her birthday So now I have it narrowed down to 2 Since I don39t yet have a dishwasher I think I39ll choose 3 The plan is to make biscuits that aren39t too hard and to use the cute scalloped cookie cutters that I borrowed from Jessica to cut out cute bitesized biscuits Then I39ll cut each strawberry into heart shapes Then I have to attempt to make a whipped cream that will hold up outside of the fridge for a number of hours this is the real challenge I think I nailed it The scalloped heart biscuit The whipped cream that held up to piping and even stayed throughout the night The heart shaped strawberry slices held together with heart toothpicks So that was part 1 of the Jessica birthday weekend Part 2 consisted of a tea party at the Crown amp Crumpet popup shop in New People Mall I39ve only ever been to the big Crown amp Crumpet for Jessica39s half birthday one year so this was a bit different but it did not disappoint Our server or as they call them 34Trolly Dolly34 was a super cute punk rock girl with colored hair and an adorable voice Even though I brought my own creamer they offer soymilk but I am really partial to the coconut creamer by so delicious and my own daiya cheese for the tricolores sandwich It39s vegan if you just have them make it without the mozzarella but I39m a piggie and I wanted the cheese on it our Trolley Dolly still said I was the best vegan she39s ever had That is the first time anyone has ever said that to me I can die now Here39s a picture of my plate The house salad is vegan by default And the adorable birthday girl Jessica And what would a trip to Japantown be

butter Why am I always the last person to hear about these things I followed this recipe exactly but I think I39ll make a few changes in the future I used a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar because I don39t have nor have I ever heard of coconut vinegar And I used the liquid soy lecithin because I prefer the taste or lack of taste I should say over the dry The recipe suggested using Tovolo ice cube

attending a couple of vegan beer fests and jpop summit recently I told myself to start avoiding activities where there are large amounts of people This epiphany was based on a couple of factors one being the fact that I don39t really care for other humans and the other being that I don39t have the patience to wait in long lines before getting what I want So when I found out there was an art amp wine festival a few blocks from my house I was a bit hesitant to attend However the thought of walking around carrying my polka dotted wine glass helped me get over any doubts I may have had Since I wasn39t sure what vegan wine options there would be we started our walk with a glass of wine from home called Barrel 27 High on the Hog from 2010 Upon arrival I was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn39t as crowded as the events that had scared me away from attending such festivals There was far more art than wine for sure and the only vineyard I actually talked with was Bonterra where I discovered that their white wines are vegan but not their reds Another benefit of their winery is that they39re not only organic but biodynamic I think I might visit their winery next time I39m in Mendocino In case you39re ever unsure whether a wine is vegan and you don39t have the opportunity to talk with the winery in person the barnivore website is a good resource they also have a phone app called vegaholic Some of the art we saw that we liked included a woodworking booth where we bought the cutest cutting board and serving tray it39s reversible I have ever seen with 6 or 7 different types of wood in it It39s made by a small shop called Hardwood Creations that39s located near Sacramento There was also a vendor there that made the most adorable dresses but they39re only in kiddo sizes Why do kids get all the cute clothes So I of course had to come straight home and make a similar but enormous dress to fit me Since I have no boobs I made the back and front the exact same size and shape so I can choose each day which way I want to wear it Maybe I was secretly trying to follow the reversible theme that my new cutting board had spawned Another enticing thing I saw at the festival was a little girl eating a delicious looking ice cream cone I don39t think downtown Mountain View serves vegan ice cream cones anywhere so I decided to make my own at home I started with a box of plain cones Next I melted about a third of a bag of chocolate chips While the chocolate was melting I gathered up some sprinkles and such I know it can be difficult to find vegan sprinkles trust me I39m constantly on the lookout Here are a couple of brands that I know of that are vegan but if you have other suggestions please comment below One thing I39ve been looking for forever that I can39t seem to find is vegan starshaped sprinkles I have them on my tattoo but have never had them in real life If you know where to get them I might propose marriage Once the chocolate is melted dip the cone into it Next before the chocolate dries dip the cones into vegan sprinkles or shredded coconut or cookie crumbs or mini chocolate chips or anything really Then let them air dry Or if you39re impatient like me and have been craving an ice cream cone since you saw a little girl eating one hours before then stick them in the freezer for 1015 minutes Once the chocolate has hardened top with ice cream I39ve been on this kick for the past couple of months where I only want to eat the chocolate salted caramel ice cream from Steve39s because basically all other ice cream tastes subpar after having that kind So yeah that39s how the art amp wine festival basically wrote the agenda for my entire day "},{"title":"East Bay Excursion","section":"blog","thumbnail":"/images/sanctuary-bistro3.jpg","date":"2014-09-09","href":"/blog/2014-09-09-east-bay-excursion","content":" East Bay Excursion Ive been wanting to check out Sanctuary Bistro in Berkeley since they opened a few weeks ago I finally had a free day so I planned a few other east bay activities to partake in before din din It started with a trip to East Bay Depot where I found some Hello Kitty stationary and a lavender tablecloth for only 6 Since we were right next to Sacred Wheel we stopped in to share a grilled cheese and learned that now they have quite a few vegan items on the menu They had a gazpacho which was a nice alternative to the Pabst Blue Ribbon tomato soup that I usually order to dip my grilled cheese in Another nice change was that instead of daiya they now make their grilled cheese with a nutbased cheese thats quite good Next was Artis for their famous vanilla almond milk lattes They make their own vanilla from vanilla beans so its quite a treat While I was paying for my latte I noticed a sign near the register that they carry Genuto a locally made gelato that I recently heard about but havent tried yet When I asked the cashier about it she informed me that they use it to make vegan affogatos It was too late for me to change my order and much too late in the day to have 2 coffees so Ill have to go back for that After Artis we hit up the Crate amp Barrel Outlet Store on the same block where I got 6 cute new dishes to match the square white set I currently have from there Of course no trip to Berkeley would be complete without a trip to Republic of V They didnt have the new cool whip I was looking for but I did manage to find these new items that I hadnt tried before The sea salt chocolate covered caramels were super good The sausages are a lot different from the field roast breakfast sausages they39re bigger they39re saltier and they taste more like real meat I think I prefer the field roast ones When we first got to Sanctuary Bistro they somehow didnt have our reservation and it took them about 5 minutes of looking concerned and worrying us before they finally agreed to let us stay That was kind of annoying but then when we sat down they had black napkins in these cute fork napkin rings so I quickly forgot about the rocky start For each thing we ordered Ill list a description paste a picture and give my opinion on how it was Artisan plate Flax crackers with cashew chevre pecan mousse and citrus tofu with a side of roasted rosemary figs I wasnt a fan I dont know what chevre is supposed to taste like since I havent eaten cheese in 15 years and when I did it certainly wasnt anything fancy This cashew cheese was really bland The good thing about it was its smoothness which is usually my challenge when I make cashew cheese The pecan mousse was too sweet for my liking The tofu tasted lemony and was better than the nut cheeses which is soooo weird because I usually dont like tofu I tasted the fig and it tasted smoked which I also wasnt a fan of Overall this was a waste of 14 for me MacadamiaMiso salad Romaine lettuce avocado Eatwell Farm cherry tomatoes and tempeh croutons with a macadamia miso dressing Im sorry I didnt take a picture of this one but I was kinda starving at this point Haha It just looked like a caesar salad nothing special I liked the dressing a lot but the croutons were NOT croutons They were soggy and the flavor wasnt a nice crouton flavor It was just pieces of tempeh but when youre expecting croutons its a grave disappointment Carrot Pt Compliments of the chef atop a cucumber slice This carrot pt was really yummy and was my second favorite thing we had This was given complimentary to all the diners and probably should be on the menu considering that I liked it more than many of the things we ordered Also it was cute to see it served on a cucumber slice since that was how I served my artichoke pt that I made a couple of months ago Crabless cakes Oyster mushroom patties with microgreens and a remoulade sauce These were the best thing we ordered They tasted like they were made with Bulghur Wheat or Kasha They had oyster mushrooms as well as a lot of other veggies I think I liked the tartar sauce the best It had a ton of dill in it which made it super delish Im probably going to try to make these at home sometime but mine will be cuter shapes than circles Ravioli Filled with mushroom duxelle in a spinach cream sauce topped with braised carrot and zucchini The flavor of this was good but the consistency of the ravioli was really weird It tasted thick and doughy and more like dumplings than ravioli Ive been wanting to make my own ravioli but this was discouraging It makes me think its more difficult than I had imagined because they most certainly did not nail it Decadent Chocolate Parfait Chocolate mousse with coconut whipped cream topped with a mini almond butter cup Im not sure that decadent is the right word to describe this It was good dont get me wrong but I think the chocolate parfait at veggie grill is more decadent than this was The mousse was quite light and airy which is hard to do with vegan mousse in my opinion The coconut whipped cream tasted like it had lemon zest in it which was unusual The almond butter cup was tasty and similar to the ones I make In addition to the fiasco we had with our reservation being lost and some of the food being less than desirable there were other strange happenings that made me feel like this restaurant had a curse put on it or something Not once but twice different servers managed to spill water either on themselves or on the poor women dining at the table next to ours Also even though our table was the furthest from the kitchen the noise of dishes clattering was so loud that at a couple points I almost plugged my ears Im not sure whats going on with the acoustics in that place but maybe they should turn up the music to drown out the sounds clanking from the kitchen All in all I wont be going back to spend 90 on a subpar dinner Id rather spend 30 more and go to Millenium for a fine dining experience that I know I will enjoy and where I am always treated in very high regard by the staff "},{"title":"Vegan Hot Fudge

couldn39t share the pictures with the world because the cookie bowls ended up looking like the hunchcookie of vegan dollhouse They were not attractive Or as the book Wonder that Isabelle has been reading to me says 34The universe was not kind to those cookie bowls34 This time I used the knowledge I gained from my disastrous experience even though it goes completely against all of my personal beliefs That important life lesson was that less is more Let me backtrack for one sec I happened to have had a 40 off coupon for Michaels which is the only reason I own this item that is basically only good for one purpose although I will make it my mission to use for at least 3 other things so I dont feel like Im sacrificing my precious kitchen space for little reason If you don39t already have this cookie bowl making pan made by Wilton you can probably drape your cookie dough over the back of a cupcake or muffin pan and get a similar result So this time instead of molding the cookie dough all the way to the base of the cookie bowl sheet I experimented with different levels of 34using less34 cookie dough Even though I tried to be so modest with the cookie dough some of them still ended up a bit monstrous I39m looking at you cookie bowl in the lower right corner I also think that next time I might try using the cookie recipe without the mini chocolate chips and pressing the

yourself but there just aren39t enough hours in every day for me to make everything from scratch Also when I make my own it doesn39t come in this jar with the adorable melted chocolate wax lid I make my own whipped cream out of coconut cream because I think all the vegan whipped creams on the market currently suck but Im sooooo excited about So Delicious coming out with cool whip next month If you

at a store on his way home from school buying a pack of gum and basically chewing the entire thing while doing homework before I even arrive home from work I read the ingredients on the pack of gum and I was appalled I39ve spent this kid39s entire life feeding him all organic vegan food and not even buying him toothpaste that has toxic ingredients only to find out that he will apparently put ANYTHING into his body without even batting one of his long lush gorgeous eyelashes he definitely didn39t get those from me SooooI went online and looked for some allnatural gum There are surprisingly quite a few that I would approve of but there was one that stood out to me as being the most cute and fun one It39s difficult to get someone to break a habit unless there39s an incentive right So in this case I discovered there are quite a few incentives TreeHugger bubble gum comes in a lot of fun flavors Pomegranate Lemonade Wildberry Watermelon and Tangerine just to name a few We did a few tests of the gum and below are the results of these tests Test 1 Flavor The youngest reports 34I like this gum We should get this gum all the time34 The eldest reports 34The complex flavor profile blends well to make a delectable gum34 What he seemed to like the most about the TreeHugger bubble gum is that the flavors weren39t simple He feels like most bubble gum has very simple flavors and just a lot of sugar I liked the flavors too They start to wear off after about 10 minutes but there39s still a slight hint of flavor that remains Test 2 Bubble blowing The gumballs come in the 2 sizes that we are accustom to gumballs being small and large We were able to blow small bubbles with around 34 of the small gumballs but had to chew around 56 to get the large sized bubbles you see here Test 3 Nutritional value This is my favorite part These are made with only natural colors but they still look so pretty There are no artificial flavors or ingredients that I can39t pronounce It39s also glutenfree which I39m sure is a plus for a lot of families but doesn39t really apply to ours I hope one of the stores in SF sells the individually wrapped large gumballs so I can pass them out on

the last few olives that were in an olive jar in my fridge Sometimes people have cute mason jars lying around but any old jar will do Remove the label if there is one Clean the jar and dry it really well Step 2 Make a new label for the jar I made mine on the computer and printed it on label paper but you can just draw on label paper or print one on regular paper and tape or glue it on You don39t even really need a label This is basically optional Step 3 Write or type out the instructions to accompany the muffin mix My instructions said this but if you already know that your recipient has a muffin pan bigger cubbies than cupcake pans you can cusomtize the cooking time to 3035 minutes for muffinsized pans Step 4 Cut out a circle of fabric slightly larger than your lid punch a hole in your instruction card and cut a piece of ribbon long enough to wrap around the lid and tie in a bow Step 5 Make the muffin mix in two separate bowls Bowl 1 Sift together 2 cups organic unbleached flour 15 tablespoons baking powder and a half teaspoon of salt Bowl 2 Sift together 34 cup sucanat or coconut sugar 12 cup whole wheat pastry flour 12 tablespoon cinnamon 12 teaspoon nutmeg 12 teaspoon ginger and 14 teaspoon cloves Step 6 Layer the two mixes into the jar Add chocolate chips at the top These muffins taste great with a half bag of chocolate chips but if you can fit more into your jar then the muffins will probably taste even better Step 7 Optional Bundle the muffin mix with the other necessary ingredients so that the birthday girl has everything needed to make them "},{"title":"Wisdom Tooth Weekend","section":"blog","thumbnail":"/images/wisdom-tooth-weekend1.jpg","date":"2014-09-22","href":"/blog/2014-09-22-wisdom-tooth-weekend","content":" Wisdom Tooth Weekend Listening to Wisdom Tooth Weekend by Sicko You like me and probably 99 of the US population probably got your wisdom teeth taken out when you were around 18 years old My boyfriend grew up in Spain and apparently in Spain they live by a motto that39s something similar to 34if it ain39t broke don39t fix it34 Or maybe I39m thinking of the south Regardless he got his wisdom teeth taken out today at the abnormal age of 34 There are all these rules about what he39s allowed to eat when so I thought I might as well document it for any other vegans who have to undergo this experience and are in need of a cheat sheet Day 1 Right after the extraction you39re not allowed to eat anything for about 4 hours You can39t even really drink water because your mouth is stuffed with gauze and you look like a chipmunk Once the anesthesia wears off you should start taking your medications that your dentist prescribed with ice water In day one cold drinks are the best thing for you You shouldn39t have anything hot or even warm After a glass of ice water and a pain pill the bleeding should be almost stopped At this point if you don39t want to look like the cute little chipmunk that you are you can wrap an ice pack in a kitchen towel and hold it onto your cheeks for 20 minutes on and 20 minutes off to help bring down the swelling Meal 1 Chocolate Peanut Butter Milkshake 2 frozen bananas 2 tablespoons cocoa powder 3 tablespoons peanut butter teaspoon vanilla extract 1 scoop chocolate protein powder I use Vega cup soymilk Directions Blend the ingredients together until there are no more chunks of banana Snack 1 Guacamole I didn39t make this from scratch but you can I bought organic guacamole from Costco a few days before the surgery Instead of having it with chips you just eat bites of it from a spoon Yum Meal 2 Tomato Soup 1 can organic tomato sauce 1 can unsweetened nondairy milk teaspoon onion powder teaspoon garlic powder teaspoon pepper teaspoon salt Tomato Soup directions Whisk the ingredients together If the milk came out the fridge you should heat it on low until it39s room temperature Meal 3 Chocolate Pudding cup organic sugar cup cocoa powder cup organic cornstarch teaspoon salt 3 cups organic soymilk 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Chocolate Pudding directions Whisk the dry ingredients together Add the milk slowly while whisking until it39s completely mixed Heat in a medium saucepan over medium heat whisking every minute or two Whisk continuously for 23 minutes as soon as it starts to bubble and thicken Remove from heat pour into glasses and chill all day or overnight in the fridge Day 2 Meal 1 Yogurt Thank you Wholesoy for making yogurt again because trying to come up with this many soupy food ideas on my own is difficult and quite honestly I hate the taste of every other vegan yogurt sold in this country Make sure you don39t eat berryflavored yogurt because any tiny seeds could get caught in the gaping holes where your teeth used to be Meal 2 Organic Tomato Juice I haven39t been listing all the drinks here but we39ve been having ice water cold juice and chilled coconut water between meals The reason I39m listing this one as a meal is because tomato juice is so thick and filling that I think it sort of counts as a meal Snack 1 Cold Brew Coffee This is the first time you39re allowed to have coffee Yay After the surgery you have to wait 24 hours before consuming alcohol or caffeine Since all beverages you consume are supposed to be cold today we39re having our coffee in the form of cold brew If you aren39t familiar with cold brew it39s a healthier way to consume coffee has a milder taste and has more caffeine Since the caffeine content is higher you don39t want to drink a glass of it It39s concentrated I usually mix mine with vanilla coconut coffee creamer and soymilk You probably think the one with the whipped cream on top is for the one recovering from oral surgery but you39d be wrong That one is for meeeeeee Meal 3 Jello There are many different varieties of packaged vegan jello on the market some of them better than others Jello is so easy to make whether you have a package or are just using juice and agar agar This one sets really well but it uses xylitol as the sweetener which I39m not a big fan of so I probably won39t buy it again Meal 4 Carrot Ginger Miso Soup Saut a diced onion 4 cloves of diced garlic and 2 pounds of thinly sliced carrots in a few tablespoons of olive oil Once the onion is translucent add enough water to cover the carrots a heaping tablespoon of miso and some bouillon Cook on low for a few hours and then use an immersion blender to pure it enough for the recovering patient to be able to eat it If you don39t have a handheld blender you can use a regular blender but you39ll have to blend it in a few batches Make sure you let it cool a lot before the wisdomtoothless consumes it Dessert Chocolate Salted Caramel Ice Cream by Steve39s Day 3 This is the first day you can actually start having real food They have to be soft foods though Meal 1 Tofu Scramble Make a really basic scramble Mince the onions in a food processor before sauting them to make sure your patient won39t have difficulty trying to chew anything too big Meal 2 Raw Tiramisu I made up a recipe loosely based on the live love eat raw recipe It has a lot of nuts in it so it39s filling but soft enough to eat on day 3 Meal 3 Mashed potatoes and carrots Sorry I didn39t get any pictures of this but it was just the same as making mashed potatoes but I boiled carrots with the potatoes to make it more healthy On day 3 pretty much anything mashed is okay I even left the skins on the potatoes and he had no difficulty eating it Day 4 Meal 1 Fried apples My stepmom brought over some apples but since apples are too crunchy I decided to soften them by cooking them I just cut about 4 apples into cubes and put them in a saucepan with about a half cup water I sprinkled a teaspoon of cinnamon over them and cooked them on lowmedium until the water was gone Meal 2 Hummus Crackers chips and raw veggies are too crunchy so hummus by the spoonful is the best way to consume it right now If you don39t have time to plan out your wisdom tooth shopping in advance then you can make your own hummus fairly easily at home if you have a blender or food processor Just use chickpeas tahini lemon juice I didn39t have any lemons so I used lime juice and it was fine and garlic salt or salt garlic powder Meal 3 Starfishy cakes These are made with kasha and roasted red peppers At this point the wisdom toothless can basically eat anything that39s not too crunchy All cooked grains pastas beans and veggies should be fine Just stay clear from chips raw veggies crackers and basically anything crispy crunchy or that requires a lot of chewing for the next week or two Don39t forget to put your teeth under your pillow for the tooth fairy unless your dentist is selfish and keeps your teeth for himself like David39s dentist did

feel kinda silly writing a blog post on cold brew since it39s so easy to make but I guess it seems weird not to include it on my website since it39s such a huge part of my diet I have a coffee addiction A big one I limit myself to drinking coffee twice a day but in actuality I want to drink it all day long The second I finish drinking it I wish there was more and the only reason I eat lunch is so that I can earn my second cup of coffee The first time I ever had cold brew was at cafe gratitude about 10 years ago They explained the process to me as being a healthier way to consume coffee that required no heat except for in the roasting of the coffee beans of course My favorite thing to order from cafe gratitude since then has been their coffee milkshake made with cold brew Then a couple of years ago I started seeing cold brew being sold in bottles at stores My friend Eidelyn got me some Stumptown cold brew for my birthday a couple of years ago and I39ve been hooked ever since Buying cold brew is rather pricey around 10 a bottle so making your own is a good compromise because obviously living your life without it is NOT an option It39s super easy to make and the great thing is that you can use coffee that isn39t as high of quality and it still comes out tasting really good Blue Bottle coffee in San Francisco uses peaberry beans to make their iced coffee Apparently the peaberry bean is kind of known for making good iced coffee so I use it for my cold brew I39ve noticed that everyone makes theirs a little differently so my way is just one of many The first thing of importance is to grind the beans to a mediumcoarse grind I use a burr grinder so I usually set it to 35 which is about the same coarseness I use when grinding for french press coffee The amount of beans depends on how much cold brew you want to make I try to use a ratio of 16 with 1 part coffee grounds and 6 parts cold water My french press happens to be the larger one so it can hold 1 cup of grounds and 6 cups of water Without a french press you can just make this in a jar or a bowl It doesn39t really matter where you soak the coffee as long you remember to stir it every few hours When you add the water make sure it39s room temperature or colder And then give it a good stir so that all the ground become wet I usually brew mine for about 12 hours Some people only brew it for 8 hours You can experiment and see how mild or flavorful you like yours To strain it you can either use a french press or just pour it through a filter on a chemex or a coffee dripper I39ve been so hard up for coffee before that one day when I left my chemex at work I rested a funnel in the top of a glass pitcher Get creative with whatever you have lying around You can drink the cold brew as is over ice Or if you39re like me and you like your coffee to taste like coffee flavored ice cream you can add coconut creamer and soymilk Then if you39re a fat ass vegan glutton like me you can add coconut whipped cream to the top of yours "},{"title":"Happy Birthday Millennium!","section":"blog","thumbnail":"/images/millennium16.jpg","date":"2014-09-28","href":"/blog/2014-09-28-happy-birthday-millennium","content":" Happy Birthday Millennium Millennium is by far the best vegan restaurant in northern California so needless to say I dine there us much as possible I39ve been to quite a few events that they have including the southern comfort annual dinner and the winemaker39s events Tonight39s event was nothing like those but I ended up being pleasantly surprised Most of the tables were cleared out and instead of being seated upon arrival we were greeted with a glass of prosecco and noticed that everyone was walking or standing around mingling Food was being both passed around as well as offered on buffet tables for you to help yourself It was more like attending a cocktail party than dining out There was a band playing in the corner and I think I would categorize the style of music as bluegrass I didn39t take pictures of all the food and I will apologize in advance for the horrible quality of the pictures but there39s a reason why I39ve never done a blog post on my meals at Millenium before The lighting in there is romantic and not conducive to food photography The crusted trumpet mushrooms are my favorite appetizer on their menu and I order them EVERY single time I go There were 3 kinds of pt red pepper pecanmushroom and chard Surprisingly the chard pt tasted the best even though it looked the worst There were toppings for bruschetta which included an eggplant one a white bean and fennel one and an olive one The olive one was the best Some of the items being passed were their famous BBQ glazed tempeh spicy tofu marinated mushrooms gazpacho and black bean torte Look how cute the black bean tortes are There were two other notably cute items One was similar to a summer pizza Here39s a closeup And the other was a slice of watermelon radish with a cashew cheese on top There were also two kinds of salads which I didn39t partake in because I was getting really full One was lentil and the other was quinoa But I did manage to make room for half of a butternut squash pekora Then for dessert there were mini cupcakes that tasted like pia colada their famous midnight chocolate pie sorry no picture this time but since I order this every time I go I can dig up a picture from my archives if need and a lemon bar The highlight of the night just so happened to fall during dessert timea cream puff The pastry part of the cream puff tasted right on but unfortunately the cream part still didn39t taste like a traditional cream puff It was the closest vegan eclaircream puff filling I have had so far but it tasted too much like cashews unfortunately "},{"title":"Vegan Food/drink

everything cute I tend to shy away from cute things that I think that are made with toxic on nonvegan ingredients This is an extremely difficult thing to do because there are so many adorable kawaii things that aren39t vegan or have chemicals in them Until I discovered Tillen Farms I would have rather had an ice cream sundae with no cherry than use one of those super cute yet confidently bad for me maraschino cherries Luckily now I don39t have to choose to live without something awesome Tillen Farms makes a wide variety of food and drink garnishes that are all vegan I predict they are marketing towards the fancy cocktail market but there is such a nice variety of cherries that can garnish a wide variety of food items that I needed to make the world aware of these I can see some amazing black forest cakes and milkshakes with whipped cream and cherries in the vegan future The cherries come in 4 colorsflavors The tickled pink are definitely the cutest You would never guess that these are allnatural but they are My next favorite are the merry maraschino These are a nice bright red Bada bing are the traditional dark red bing cherry color that we39ve come to love and the rainier reserve are made from rainier cherries so they have that same coloring In these 2 sundaes pictured here the tickled pink is on the left and the bada bing is on the right Isabelle who normally hates maraschino cherries actually liked these I was making cute little mocktails for Zen and Isabelle with fresh ginger juice some of the juice from the cherries jar and the cherries and they LOVED them Then we decided to try out the other garnishes that Tillen Farms makes David made us bloody marys using the recipe from the Pure Vegan cookbook You probably don39t need a recipe if you buy your own veganshire sauce but this book gives you the recipe for that as well Photo credit David Calavera Another cool factoid about Tillen Farms is that their products are all made in a nutfree environment so these would be perfect for those who have severe nut allergies They39re also kosher and glutenfree in addition to being vegan It39s so nice to find a product that accommodates so many varieties of dietary restrictions You can find their products at Whole Foods at least you can at my Whole Foods but you can also order directly from their website "},{"title":"Blind Tiger dining","section":"blog","thumbnail":"/images/SMvegan7.jpg","date":"2014-10-04","href":"/blog/2014-10-04-blind-tiger-dining","content":" Blind Tiger dining Finally I have been wanting to try SM Vegan for months now since I first heard of them and I finally got lucky enough to try it I can39t recall how I first heard of them early this year but I think I joined a meetup group in hopes of either attending or hosting one of their elusive popup dinners After realizing that their meetup group was relatively inactive I saw them listed as a vendor at the east bay vegan beer fest So even though I was packing to move that weekend I drove to the east bay just to partake in this infamous reuben Sadly the event was so crowded and the lines were so long that I had to depart before being given the opportunity to try some of their delectable fare Soon after Republic of V tagged SMvegan on instagram to show off their sandwiches they started carrying So I started following them in hopes of maybe having better luck with my stalking ahem I mean finding out about their events before they39re over And it worked Just days before David39s birthday they posted that they had 3 tickets left to the blind tiger dinner which was taking place a couple of days from then Since the location was a secret when I purchased the tickets I39m guessing that39s the 34blind34 part of the blind tiger dinner This couldn39t have been more perfect since I had not yet thought of a birthday present for David On the day of the event the location was announced and I left early to make sure there wasn39t some autoinduced death or sportsball game causing a traffic delaynothing would keep me from finally tasting this mysterious cuisine Since traffic seemed to be in my favor I had time to stop at Republic of V to pick up Miyoko39s new cheese which is delicious and I highly recommend it to anyone who has yet to partake The location of the event was in a warehouseart studiooffice building of sorts with a skylight and ideal lighting so lucky for you these pictures look 3465936 times better than any I have ever taken at Millennium While waiting for the remaining 18 diners to arrive we talked with Dan who owns Bison Brewery We learned all about his brewing techniques how few certified organic breweries there actually are in the United States and how his partnership in the blind tiger dinners is such an integral part of the event I39m not much of a beer drinker so I didn39t actually benefit from this but there were beer pairings with 5 of the 6 courses at dinner including a Red Reuben beer with the reuben course and a chocolate stout with dessert We also learned that much of the food we ate during the dinner was cooked using the bison beer So apparently I do like beer afterallit just has to be prepared by Shane and Marie in the form of exquisite noms Course 1 Tacos There were 3 kinds of tacos Red chili pepper stuffed with cashew cheese trumpet mushroom and eggplant Course 2 Salad with tapenade shards In case you missed that I said tapenade shards This is complete and utter brilliance They looked so cute sticking out of the salad like thin purple crackers but more importantly if you think you like olive tapenade you will LOVE these The salad also had green zebra tomatoes early girl tomatoes and massive croutons that I couldn39t eat in one bite from Morrell39s Bread I get the feeling that SMvegan gets all their ingredients from local sources Course 3 Smoked popcorn This was smoked popcorn on top of a teeny tiny potato the size of a grape stuffed with potato and shiro miso on top of a shiso leaf I was glad this course was tiny because even without drinking beer I was already starting to feel like I might not make it through 6 courses And I love all the shades of purple in this dish Course 4 Polenta This ragu dish had polenta mushrooms almonds and tongue of fire beans The crazy thing is that when Shane was introducing the dish and mentioned the tongue of fire beans I thought it was something new I had never heard of But once I googled it I see that they are the beans I39ve been buying at farmer39s market that are being referred to cranberry beans Needless to say it was delicious I had seconds even though I was getting full Course 5 Buildyourownreuben slate This was the best thing everrrrrrrrrrr Not just because I had been waiting to try their reuben since vegan beer fest but because this seitan could easily be the best seitan I have ever tasted In life Seriously I guess it was marinated in the red reuben beer that was paired with this course Shane said he slices it by hand It was the perfect thicknesslike 05 mm Ha Not really but I hate how every packaged seitan at stores is so thick Who wants that I39m pretty sure nobody wants that but vegans are too nice to be fussy So on behalf of all vegans everywhere please seitan makers slice it thinner I also learned that Shane and Marie might be willing to be talked into selling their seitan in quantities of 5 pounds or more so if anyone wants to share some seitan with me you know where to find me sitting in the vegan dollhouse kitchen with piles of seitan in my lap hands and mouth I also loved how this dish was served on a piece of slate The presentation of the entire meal was so pretty And those cured beets were so delicious The butter next to the bread was handmade using maize Okay I could go on and on about this course alone but I will stop now For you Course 6 Dessert I almost didn39t think I would have room for dessert but then I remembered that I39m mewhich means my dessert stomach is a completely different one and there is infinite room in it I39ve never made creme brle before because it doesn39t contain chocolate so I figured what39s the point But now that I39ve tasted it I understand the point Finally my neglected torch will be coming out of the cupboard This one was made with almond milk and corn which was a nice reprieve from the typical coconut everything I tend to make I didn39t take any pictures of the way everything was laid out but basically everyone sat at a long table with the dishes with the exception of dessert being served family style I even made a friend who sat next to me taught me about all kinds of new things and we even have plans to decorate vegan cakes together in the near future These blind tiger dinners apparently take place the last Sunday of every month so if you are interested in checking one out visit the SM Vegan website to learn more Disclaimer I39m not promoting stalking as a way to get what you want in all situationsjust those involving vegan food "},{"title":"Vegan Products for 2015","section":"blog","thumbnail":"/images/Steves2.jpg","date":"2015-03-08","href":"/blog/2015-03-08-vegan-products-for-2015","content":" Vegan Products for 2015 Ohhhh Natural Products Expo West how do I love thee Let me count the ways I guess this Sweet Earth vegan bacon has been out for awhile but I39ve never seen it at my Whole Foods and I very rarely go to Target which is apparently the one store that carries all of their products At the expo booth they were serving virgin bloody marys with this bacon as the garnish so I will of course be doing this at home soon It39s really yummy and it doesn39t have a consistency similar to bacon at all which is what I love about it It reminds me of the Morning Star bacon I used to buy before I went vegan So good I wish it were organic but otherwise the ingredients are pretty healthy I only wish that Sweet Earth was an allvegan company I hate label reading Beyong Meat for sure had the most clever booth with their mock McDonalds I don39t know who39s in charge of their marketing over there but I39d like to meet them Brilliant They even gave out cute little happy meal toys to those waiting in line They gave out a little hamburger and some chicken sticks The hamburger tasted way too real for my liking but I heard some omnivores talking about how it was good but didn39t taste authentic enough Shows what I know The breading on the chicken tenders was thicker than the ones on gardein chicken nuggets maybe because it was glutenfree so I wasn39t a huge fan of those either I guess I just love plain chicken strips from this company so I can bread them and fry them myself at home I39ve been a fan of calafia since they first came onto the market with their almond milk Then my interest waned when the consistency of their milk changed to be thicker than I prefer But then they came out with their almond milk creamers which I love I nowwwwww this Triple shot cold brew bottled coffees I cannot wait for these I haven39t had a bottled vegan readytodrink coffee beverage that I39ve liked until now The mexican mocha flavor was sooooooo gooooood I39ve been on the hunt for natural vegan food dyes for basically ever good bright onesnot those stupid India Tree ones that just make everything look like different shades of brown I saw this company in Republic of V awhile back and when I went back to buy it they didn39t carry it anymore So you can imagine how excited I was to see the Color Garden booth They even had cookies and a cake that they had decorated using the coloring so you could see what it actually looks like I got a sample that I be testing out soon and reviewing on here hopefully So excited Daiya is coming out with 3 flavors of mac n cheese The 2 cheddar flavors aren39t good But this alfredo flavor is delicious enough for all 3 of them The new Supreme Pizza was my favorite of the 3 new pizza flavors They formed a partnership with beyond meat to make a sausage pizza that seriously reminds me so much of the Zpizza vegan pizza with the topping they call veggie burger crumbles I was already prepared for what these Daiya cheesecakes would taste like because I39ve made a cheesecake using Daiya creamcheese by following the recipe on their website I39m not a fan It just doesn39t taste the kind I39m used to because they39re nobake cheesecakes I like the baked ones However the amount of cacao in this chocolate flavored one was just enough bitterness to counterbalance the flavor of the daiya creamcheese that I don39t care for so I actually thought the chocolate cheesecake was good I didn39t taste the key lime one but I heard it was good as well which makes sense because lime is an overpowering flavor as well The Follow Your Heart booth was so adorable These new cheeses they came out with are super yummy They39re way better than the other follow your heart cheeses and definitely on par with Chao Cheese Look how cute these little baby lunch box size ones are I39m a weird pickypants when it comes to mock seafood so I didn39t think I would like these Gardein crab cakes but I was wrong Very wrong And the guys at the Gardein booth were super nice and helpful and told me about the restaurant we ended up having dinner at that night since I had never been there before If you haven39t been to Healthy Junk in Anaheim I highly recommend it Again Gardein impressed me with their fish sticks Although I did hear some others saying that when they bake them according to instructions on the package they never taste as good I guess I just need a Gardein employee to come home with me and feed me I know we all love Justin39s PB cups so of course a cuter mini version of them made me fall even harder in love I took this picture for Kimmy because she love love loves these crackers Another vegan food color company Yessssss This one is made by Glob which I recognized because they make allnatural fingerpaint for kids I was lucky enough to get a sample of this as well so when I test out the Color Garden colors I39ll be testing this as well As you can tell by the million pictures Owl39s Brew won the award for cutest booth I fell in love They were also serving craft cocktails so that could have helped They told me I could find these at BevMo so I went to BevMo a few days later looking for them but they said they were discontinued sadface I39ve been paying a lot of attention to nail polish lately because I really like painting my nails but I don39t like all the chemicals Pacifica is a brand that claims to be free of 7 of the toxins that are commonly found in nail polish I39m hoping to review them soon but if you39d like to see a list of polishes that are vegan check out my newest blog post Scotch Naturals is another company that is free of 7 of the toxins They said they just reformulated their product to make it better and I smelled it and it actually did smell odorless I haven39t tried this yet but I39m hoping to do a review soon I really like the cinnamon flavor the best Not a fan of the pomegranate Rebel Kitchen won the award for the coolest booth Seriously The white brick wall with the cutestever black graphic They make these coconut milk drinks I liked the chocolate one I hesitate to compare it to Yoohoo because who the hell knows what used to be in that stuff but it was slightly reminiscent Now everyone knows how old I am Secret39s out These dinners were yummy but the chick who worked the booth either hated me or hated her life She was not nice at all When I asked her why they didn39t use organic noodles they used all organic ingredients except for the noodles she rudely informed me that there39s no such thing as organic rice noodles I didn39t argue with her I just moved on Steve39s I was so happy that they were there I39m seriously a psycho fan of this stuff I39ve been a regular consumer of the chocolate salted caramel ice cream ever since Sprouts started carrying it I tried to visit their warehouse when I was in New York Psycho fan status I also love the trader joes speculoos cookies so you can imagine my glee when I saw this at their booth I almost couldn39t contain my excitement so instead of exploding I politely read psychoticly informed the booth attendent that I basically already invented this flavor when I made ice cream cookie sandwiches on national ice cream sandwich day with the speculoos cookies and Steve39s cinnamon cold brew coffee ice cream They didn39t have security escort me out so either I did a good job acting normal or they were just very very nice Tofurky was sampling a couple of things The one I didn39t care for was the chick39n salad which is why there39s no picture of it However this tandoori chick39n was crazy good And I don39t even usually care for Indian food so they did a great job with this one TruJoy vegan starbursts were at the Surf Sweets booth Are they the same company They must be Not everything they have is vegan but they do have vegan starburst and vegan tootsie rolls I39ve had this cheese before in London but so much time had passed that I had forgotten what it tasted like It39s quite similar to the Chao and the new Follow Your Heart cheese Some vegan food blogger speculate that all three companies are partnering with the same manufacturer in Europe which is why they39re all so similar I

Sofa","section":"blog","thumbnail":"/images/sofa6.jpg","date":"2015-04-16","href":"/blog/2015-04-16-how-to-make-your-couch-purple","content":" Make Your Own Purple Sofa I39ve wanted a purple couch for like ever I see them now and then about as often as I see purple cars and admire them from afar Since I tend not to spend much money on things that aren39t edible not including rent and bills I don39t usually get the chance to own specialty items unless I make them myself or my friends gift them to me Luckily only because I39m a glass halffull type of personotherwise I would consider this quite unlucky when David and I combined houses I was basically gifted a very pale grayishbeigish Ikea Kivik sofa When we first put it in the living room with my pretty black and green furniture it must have felt like an outsider My furniture isn39t the type to make fun of others but there39s no way David39s couch has been feeling at home here After many attempts at finding reasonablypriced covers for this sofa I finally started looking at alternatives Some people paint their couches which looks really good when it39s done but I was slightly concerned about the comfort of the sofa afterwards That39s when I settled on dying it I39ve ordered dye from Dharma before and I like their quality so I contacted them to find out which dyes were vegan Every color that is a Fiber Reactive Procion Dye is vegan I ordered the following items from Dharma 4 oz deep purple colored dye 1 pound soda ash fixer 5 pounds salt Total cost w shipping 25 Step 1 Remove the cover from your couch The kivik is easy because it comes in a lot of pieces and they39re all attached to the wooden sofa with velcro Sorry I didn39t take a good before picture but here39s David taking the sofa apart Step 2 Prewash the cover They tell you to use their special soap but I just used my regular ecofriendly soap that I use for all my laundry They also say to use hot water but I was scared that my cover would shrink and not fit back onto the couch so I used warm I also have a front loading washing machine which makes it harder than using a top loading machine but one advantage to the LG front loading machine is that it has a setting for bulkylarge loads so I used that Since the dye needs to be soaking into the fabric for a certain period of time the tricky part of dying things in a washing machine is that you have to stop the machine before it goes from the wash cycle to the rinse cycle so while I was prewashing I actually sat in my garage in front of the washer and stared at it until it switched from wash to rinse so I would know the exact moment when it would happen On mine that moment is between 31 and 29 I know that wasn39t a completely exact moment but Jessica was texting me a crazy story about a text she got from one of her coworkers so how could I not get distracted Step 3 When the washer is done remove the damp covers from the washer and set them on the floor or a table until you39re ready to put them back into the washer At this point I refered to some instructions that someone contributed to the Dharma website here and put my own twist on it Step 4 On the stovetop boil a half of a pot of water using your largest pot Then slowly add the salt a cup at a time dissolving each cup thoroughly I used a whisk before adding the next cup I think I used a total of 8 cups of salt When it was completely dissolved the water still looked really white like paint water Step 5 Use a medium sized glass bowl for the dye Add the dye and then add warmhot water and stir with a plastic spoon This is where some people use Urea to help mix the dye so you don39t get tiny dark spots but urea isn39t vegan and I am dying dark purple so spots won39t show up like they would if I were dying a pastel color Step 6 Start the washer After 12 minutes pause the load and when the door unlocks open it and pour in the salt water Then close it and start it again Step 7 Pause the washer after another minute or 2 and open the door once it unlocks Add the dye mixture Then start it again Lay some rags on the floor in front of the washer because the next time you open it some dyed water will drip off the door onto the floor Step 8 After another minute or 2 pause open and add the fabric Then start the load again Step 9 Five minutes before your washer is about to switch to the rinse cycle or more if you39re concerned about time mix your soda ash I did this by using my largest pot the same one I used for dissolving the salt and filled it 23 to 34 full with hot tap water I then added a cup of soda ash and whisked it until it was completely dissolved and the water turned clear 23 minutes Step 10 Pause the washer turn it off turn it on turn the dial to the wash setting you used before mine was BulkyLarge and start it Then every 3060 seconds add about 34 cup of the soda ash water to the soap compartment Whenever the soap compartment is empltied again fill it Repeat this until you have used up all the soda ash water It took me the entire length of a wash cycle about 22 minutes plus part of a second cycle until it was gone Step 11 Remember no matter what before the cycle switches to rinse pause the washer turn it off turn it on turn the dial to the wash setting you used before mine was BulkyLarge and start it You never want to let it get to the rinse cycle or it will drain all your dye and ruin your life or maybe just the day Step 12 You39ll want to repeat the washing cycle at least twice after the soda ash water is completely incorporated For darker colors you can even do it a third time I39m impatient so I only restarted twice Step 13 Once your fabric has been agitating in the dye and soda ash for a minimum of 30 minutes and a maximum of an hour let the wash cycle run its complete course Make sure that when it39s on the rinse cycle that the water temperature is turned to cold Step 14 When that load is complete you want to wash it once last time as you would wash any load of laundry with detergent and fabric softener They say to use hot water but again I was scared of shrinking my cover so I used cold Step 15 Drying Ideally to make sure you don39t shrink your fabric hanging things out to dry is the best However I39m a bit short on places to hang large laundry items such as sofa covers so I put mine in the dryer on ultra low We had some difficulty getting the covers on so I would suggest using all cold water and not using the dryer to dry them Shared on tutorial tuesdays and wicked awesome wednesday "},{"title":"Unicorn Birthday

to make sure I did something different so I would remember it forever The answer was obvious Ride a unicorn And nobody wants to ride a unicorn alone so I coerced some friends to ride unicorns with me Here we are walking from Pam39s house to the Zeum Museum We thought my dress might be floofy enough to hide everyone behind it so of course the theory had to be tested Is this the unicorn I get to ride I thought I would have to drag them kicking and screaming into this adventure but there was no kicking and only some minor yelping which may have come from me but I still got to drag them Unicorns aren39t really meant to have people riding on them so we gave them a little break while Jessica perfected her hearthands Mia and her unicorn decided to sing a duet Aren39t Jocelyn and her unicorn so photogenic AwwwwPamela ended up making friends with her unicorn Mia39s unicorn must have given her superpowers so she was able to ride with no hands and not fall off Just so you don39t think I39m a speciesist the carousel had horses too Thanks to Mel for taking pictures of us on the carousel As if riding unicorns wasn39t enough to make the best birthday ever but when we got back to

Muir39s tea room the bay area vegan girls and I decided that the next tea party would be at my house aka the Vegan Dollhouse Ashley came early to help me set up and she made these cute tea sandwiches that represent veganism and love all while hugging field roast and chao cheese They were inspired by the tea sandwiches we had at Muir39s tea room Ashley also brought some cute cucumber bunnies not because she mistakenly bought cucumbers at the store when she meant to buy zucchini just because she thought it would be a nice addition to the tea party Next to arrive was Eve and she brought these adorable ice cream sandwiches made with animal crackers I don39t know how she managed to keep them from melting on her drive from SF but if you ever need advice on how to transport a dead body or vital organ I39m pretty sure she could give you some good advice Brandi and Rosie came together and even though Brandi was extremely busy meeting and greeting and taking selfies with our canine visitor Frankie I managed to pry them away from eachother long enough to get this picture of them Since Brandi39s persuasion skills are unmatched Rosie made 2 cute items on their behalf one sweet amp one savory I would never have guessed that these were the first chocolates she39s ever made They were not only raw but they tasted delicious AND she made 3 kinds She also brought eggless salad sandwich hearts The last to arrive even though she lives the closesthaha was Tina and because her kitchen was a billion degrees today the marshmallows in her rice krispie treats decided to stay melted forever and therefore photography of her item was prohibited Lucky for us she decided to model both of the things I madethe fried macncheese hearts and the starshaped ice cream sandwiches We had a nice variety of teas that included Chai Cookie White Rose Lavender Lemon Mint Oolong Peach and Chocolate Strawberry which were accompanied by Calafia Farms Almond Milk Creamer And here39s a picture of

to potlucks because I know our bodies digest melon differently than other foods so it39s best to eat it by itself However I couldn39t think of a cuter way to serve sangria than from a piggy I started by sketching out some plans Step 1 Cut out the top piece I drew the line first to make sure I didn39t mess up Step 2 Scoop out all the melon I started to get too sticky to take pictures of steps 38 but here are some pictures of the finished piggy My final step was to make sangria in the pig The sangria had a few short steps including cutting cute shapes from some of the melon blending the rest of the melon to make watermelon juice and adding vodka and sparkling wine Cutting the watermelon shapes is an integral part to make sure your sangria is as cute as the piggy that serves it I also brought my breakfast baskets but I didn39t take any pictures of those since they39re already on this website Although the potluck had around 80 attendees I only got around to tasting a few items Jen of whollyvegan made these yummy and cutely garnished deviled potatoes Roshi made these super cute Dadar Gulung coconut pandanus pancake in a variety of different colors I think Jen also made these I

The first thing I consumed in Tokyo was a soy latte I was in the Hikarie Mall which is attached to the Shibuya train station The mall has around 10 floors and there are 3 coffee shops distributed around The elevators in the mall have a really cute voice I think the only other elevator I39ve been in that talked to me was the Twitter building elevators but this one was cuter because it was in Japanese The mall also had a juice place which sold a lot of familiar american vegan snacks The first cafe we tried was on the bottom floor and looked a lot like blue bottle so much that I39m pretty sure they ripped off their logo cups and everything else about them but they didn39t offer soymilk The second one was a success so we never visited the 3rd one The Theatre Coffee made a really good soy latte with cute latte art but it was a bit pricey Pure Cafe David had eaten dinner at Pure Cafe before and wasn39t impressed with their food so we decided to just order dessert only It was one of the only places open before 11am so it one the contest for next destination The cheesecake was quite good It used a peanut butter crust which was unique They also had glutenfree items which Kimmy would have liked Hanada Rosso Macrobiotic Vegan Restaurant Brown Rice Cafe 100 vegan restaurant and organic when possible This was mostly temple cuisine Day 2 Ainsoph journey This salad parfait was so cute that I39m going to start making these at home The dressing that came with it was so delicious that if anyone at the restaurant spoke english I would have tried to buy a bottle to take with me David ordered some sort of marinara with rice I ordered pancakes with ice cream and whipped cream The ice cream tasted like rum raisin The garnish included some berries that had a fmailiar taste but didn39t look familiar The staff spoke very little english here but the menu was partially in english Rainbow Bird Rendevous This was one of my favorite restaurants in Japanquite possibly my very favorite It39s 100 vegan GMOfree and free of refined sugars Cute ceiling decor Potato croquette Veggie burger This soft serve was the best one I had during my stay in Japan Tokyo serves soft serve ice cream with cereal in it This one had corn flakes I39ll be trying this at home Day 3 Harajuku Harajuku has a few peoplelike one or two A lot of the malls in Tokyo had cute floors Deus Ex Machina My favorite coffee shop in Tokyo was in Harajuku It39s called Deus Ex Machina They have soy lattes and do cute latte art Kurt thought it looked like lumpy space princess A trend I noticed in 34hip34 coffee shops in Japan were copper piping sinks I saw this in at least 3 different cafes One of the only times we got stuck eating at a restaurant that wasn39t vegetarian and didn39t have an English menu or any English speaking staff was in Harajuku We ended up at a place called Oriental Recipe and Cafe that39s around the corner from the Tamagachi store at the end of TakeshitaDori Luckily I pasted a bunch of Japanese characters into my journal before the trip so I could point to characters The restaurant had a vegan salad or this vegan curry They also sold these really cute heartshaped vegan snacks that we bought and ate later on our train ride to Okunoshima Giant Black Cat David read on twitter that there was a giant black cat in the Shinjuku train station puking out presents so we obviously had to go to get souvenirs for Josipa Here39s a flipagram of our visit Kuumba du Falafel I took a suggestion from Kylie and went to Kuumba du Falafel for dinner There39s just one guy who works there and not much seating but he spoke some English and was able to make us a falafel plate Day 4 Island Veggie This vegetarian restaurant was recommended to me by Eidelyn I wasn39t going to go because Happy Cow listed it as vegetarian but she assured me that most things could be made vegan so we went for breakfast It was hard to find places open early in Japan because places typically open later and stay open later at night so I was super excited that Island Veggie was open before 9am I ordered a chocolate peanut butter banana shake David ordered a ham sandwich and it came with a free coffee This sandwich was less than 700 yen making this one of the most affordable options I found in Tokyo The decor inside was super cute too And their bathrooms had the potty showers that we all come home from Japan missing Tokyo Tower The Tokyo Tower is only 1 or 2 stops away from Island Veggie so we decided to check it out The tower itself wasn39t very interesting It39s a super tall tower However because it was in Tokyo it had all this other cute stuff like a One Piece themed cafe and store I tried to go to the cafe but they didn39t offer soymilk The word for soymilk is tonyu so I basically just got into the habit of walking in everywhere and saying 34tonyu34 None of the themed restaurants and cafes I tried to go to offered anything vegan Since we got denied at the cafe there39s a park nearby that we walked around in La Petite Pattiserie de Mirayne This vegan bakery was a huge disappointment Do not waste your time going here The first time I went they were closed The second time I went they were out of mostly everything We got the black pepper crackers and the lemon cookies and they were 1000 yen for the tiniest containers But after going all the way there twice it was out of the way of everything else we had to buy something The pepper crackers had wayyyyy too much pepper Here39s Jack carrying the bag of overly priced baked goods Lima Lima is a health food store with an almost allvegan cafe We came here to look for snacks for our trip to Bunny Island but we ended up staying and eating lunch I highly recommend this place And then after eating we found all these snacks to bring with us to Bunny Island HangOut This allvegan bar was so good that we came back twice San Francisco really needs a vegan bar The things I loved about this bar were that the food tasted better than bar food in the states for instance I ordered an amazing salad both times with watermelon radish and roasted kabocha squash the employees spoke english the menu was in English and the menu had pictures so you knew what to expect Gyozas The Bloody Mary didn39t have a garnish but at least I was able to order one at night This rainbow salad could easily be the best salad I had in Japan Some type of mockmeat Rilakkuma Store in Harajuku Kiddyland Day 5 T39s Tantan T39s is located inside the Tokyo train station near the Keiyo street exit It39s super clean and modern inside They don39t have a bathroom but the bathrooms in the train station are fairly clean I got in the habit of carrying my own soap and washcloth in my purse since oftentimes the train station bathrooms didn39t have soap or hand dryers T39s was probably the most affordable vegan place I found in Tokyo so I ate here like 5 times My first time was breakfast Here39s a video of me periscoping the inside of the restaurant I ordered the shoyu ramen almost every time It was just so delicious and perfectly filling If you go for breakfast you can add a coffee for 100 yen around 1 Across the hall and to the left is a bakery Boulangerie La Terre They offer between 2 and 5 sweet and savory vegan options each day It39s all in Japanese so you have to be able to communicate with the staff By the end of my trip I knew the words for butter milk eggs meat and fish but I39ve forgotten them all already Day 6 Tokyo Skytree Almost everyday in Japan was sunny and a perfect 70 degrees However the day we visited the Tokyo Skytree it was a foggy day with a bit of rain Luckily the skytree is basically a huge 10 story indoor mall so we stayed warm and dry The disney stores there are so much cuter than ours There was a conglomeration between Disney and h NAOTO to make a Nightmare Before Christmas line I really wanted this bat purse but it39s too small to be practical You probably think that the 4 Rilakkuma stores I39ve already visited were enough You39re wrong Who39s hiding in the bushes Sasaya Cafe This was one of my favorite restaurants in Tokyo They understood english well and had an english menu They had a good selection of desserts Day 7 Sol39s Coffee These baristas were knowledgeable about SF coffee roasters like blue bottle I liked the cute mirror in the bathroom Pokemon Center Sanrioworld Ginza Disney Store I like how the Disney store looked like a castle Day 8 Tomato was an awesome fabric store located in the Nippori district It had a ton of cute fabrics and the best part was that they played poppunk music while I shopped Milencolin Pennywise etc Here are some of the cuter fabrics I spotted Komaki Shokudo This place was pretty disappointing I wouldn39t go back and I would advise against going The service was bad The food was just whatever except that it was quite expensive After eating we tried to visit some themed bars and cafes that were near the restaurant but nobody had soymilk so we didn39t stay So instead I had the fun time of trying to buy stamps and mail postcards and letters And since you asked yes Tokyo does have stamps with Hello Kitty on them While at the airport I made a list of things I would miss about Japan One thing not listed is how much nicer the airport lounges are in Japan than in america The food was labeled with allergies so I could determine some things that were vegan and I made a mimosa Here were some of the souvenirs I bought myself in the Ueno district of Tokyo and other random places here and there "},{"title":"Bunny Island","section":"blog","thumbnail":"/images/bunnyisland3.jpg","date":"2015-10-20","href":"/blog/2015-10-20-bunny-island","content":" Bunny Island Can you think of the happiest you39ve ever been in your life Maybe there are a lot of different experiences that come to mind Mine was a couple of weeks ago on Bunny Island My life is basically downhill from here haha I should probably start by admitting that I don39t really go outside I39m not outdoorsy I don39t spend my weekend mornings hiking I don39t camp It39s just not really my thing So it is possible that part of the euphoric experience of Okunoshima for me was just being in nature The island of Okunoshima itself is gorgeous Unlike the islands near San Francisco it wasn39t rocky and super steep It was relatively flat which made for easy bunny access and a remarkable view of the sunset from the island Even just the traveling to the island on the train was beautiful I loved everything about my visit and I39m counting the days until I can go back Next time I39ll stay longer than only one night I brought a lot of snack to eat on the long train ride including these heartshaped chips that we picked up in Harajuku After taking a whole bunch of train rides you arrive at a port where you wait for the ferry In case you39re unsure of where to wait there39s a helpful sign The ferry ride to the island makes you feel like you39re in a scene from Jurassic Park The hotel was a traditional Japanese hotel so at 6pm or so they come around to your room and lay out your sleeping pads on the japanese mat floors There39s a toilet and a sink in your room but the showers are in the public onsen so if you go I hope you don39t have an issue with being next to naked peoplewhile you39re nakedand if you39re me you might have to watch other people shower so that you can learn what to do because you39ve never been in an onsen before And that39s not awkward at all Don39t worry I waited until I was alone before taking these pictures of the onsen Just because I stare at people while they shower doesn39t mean I don39t know where the line is drawn and when not to cross it except for those times when I just touch my toe across the line but that doesn39t count right The hotel comes with an allyoucaneat buffet for dinner and breakfast I just assumed there would be nothing I could eat so I packed a lot of snacks for the trip However to my surprise the staff were really helpful and the other tourists too so I was able to find quite a lot of vegan food to eat there I still recommend bringing snacks though because the hotel doesn39t provide lunch and the trip to and from the island is a long journey in itself Here39s a picture of some of the food that was vegan on the breakfast buffet There was also cold tofu seaweed salad and other things that I didn39t care for In addition to bringing snacks for you you may want to bring snacks for the bunnies This is a decision each vegan must make for hisherself The island doesn39t sell food for the purpose of not wanting the bunnies to become reliant on being fed There are plenty of plants on the island that they can eat so I think the ideal situation is to let them eat what they are meant to eat However I was gifted a bag of grass pellets from a japanese girl and I fed the bunnies every last pellet It made them come to me and sit on my lap and made me the happiest I39ve ever been in life so when I go back I will be feeding them I hope that doesn39t make me a bad vegan I created a youtube channel specifically for videos of Bunny Island so if you39d like to see bunnies hopping around in their natural habitat check them out Oh and youtube won39t let me change my URL for my channel until I have 100 followers so please subscribe to my channel while you39re there And if you don39t like videos of bunnies that39s obviously impossible here are some pictures of the bunnies There are more remote areas of the island where you can go that have fewer bunnies but the ones you do find seem to be a little different They chill more and they don39t run up to you when they see you I caught this one giving herself a little bath So there39s one downside to bunny island The bunnies are hunted by crows so some of them have wounds on their ears and faces from the crow attacks I had the chance to save a baby bunny from being taken by a crow but then it made me sad to think about what will happen now that I39m not there to save all the bunnies This one on the left has a missing eye and chunks taken out of his ears If you look in the sky of this picture you can see the crow flying When the crows make a noise the bunnies all run into the woods to hide Some naughty bunny figured out where the food was coming from and decided to cut out the middleman me If you39ve ever wondered if bunnies do yoga here39s your answer This one looks like she39s smiling And I saved the best for lastthe baby bunny "},{"title":"Dolls &

this sign I started feeling like I didn39t choose the right outfit for this adventure The deerying that39s the word for when a deer bullies you that I experienced wasn39t even listed on the sign so I

I39m not sure whyyyyI39m sure it has nothing to do with him being annoyed that I refused to purchase a third bundle of crackers Another cute thing about Nara is that everything in the town seems to be deer themed from the stairs in the train station to the potholes in the roads When we were walking down the street I learned that I39ve been kneading dough the wrong way my whole life Here39s a short

live in the mountains near Kyoto There39s a fee of 5 to hike up the mountain to see them I think humans can buy food to feed them but the humans have to go inside of a cage and stick the food through the bars to the monekys who are outside I found this to be hilarious and thought of it as a human zoo where the monkeys can come to the zoo and see the humans in the cage Most of them just chill and pick bugs off eachother I was only slightly obsessed with this little baby monkey Prunus Prunus is a welllocated vegan restaurant near the train station you get off at to go the bamboo forest and to see the monkeys I was extremely pleased with everything I had here and I even made them a new location in yelp so others could find them more easily They even have a section in their menu about birdfriendly coffee which I didn39t even know was a thing Bamboo Forest Walking through the bamboo forest made me want to go home and plant a perimeter of bamboo around my house to keep muggles out Does anyone know what the dishes on the graves are for I got really good at asking cashiers to help me read labels in stores These are vegan Manga Museum I had a character drawing done at the Manga Museum and apparently if I were an anime character I would look like this Kyoto Wakuden We found this little fancy store that sold naturalcolored salt I could only afford to get the purple one but I wanted them all Day 3 Sentido I got to meet up with Alexis for coffee which was so nice because I got to ask her how to say things in Japanese and listen to her order her coffee in Japanese and basically just be enamored by her cuteness for a few moments Sentido had cute cups but I was disappointed by the number of coffee shops in Japan that couldn39t do latte art with soy Hale Hale is located in an outdoor mall in the center of Kyoto While waiting for Hale to open for lunch their hours are weird so make sure you check them before going we walked around the mall and bought cute candies and some Rilakkuma paraphenalia for mine and Jessica39s houses The mall had the cutest vending machine I had seen in my entire time in Japan The mall also had a metamorphosis if you like expensive cute dresses with lots of ruffles and bows Hale is a little bit hard to find since it39s wedged between two stands in a very crowded fleamarket type area Here is what the 2 stands to either side of it look like Left Right If you39re looking for a very traditional Japanese meal then Hale is probably good for you I personally found it to be a bit too authentic for me It was vegan temple food but the food was just a bit too different I only ate about half of it and I couldn39t even use the bathroom because it was the kind with the hole in the ground However the walk to the bathroom was quite pretty Arabica There are 2 location of this cafe One is by the monkeys The other is by a temple at the top of a hill The one by the monkeys doesn39t offer soymilk so if you are looking for a latte don39t waste your time there The latte at the one by the temple was quite good but they39re very strict about bike parking there so maybe you should walk there Here39s another vegan snack I was able to find with some help from a cashier Isn39t it cute All the stores and shops in Japan were really into decorating for Halloween It was so nice to see This is inside the Kyoto train station I

would choose it over other nondairy yogurts in a blind taste test anyday I decided I should invite some unbiased friends over to help me with this activity Instead of naming the yogurts on the scorecard I decided to make this a blind taste test for everyone by assigning each kind its own letter I then used little cups to serve the yogurt so nobody would know what brand they were eating Here are all the yogurts we used in our taste test Some of them ended up being so bad that I rinsed the rest down the drain I very rarely waste food but there are some really really bad vegan yogurts on the market Tempt should throw in the towel on making yogurt and just focus on their delicious tofu and ice cream Before giving you a synopsis of the winners for each category I39d like to share some of the comments that were made during the event 34Tastes like groundup vitamins34 34How does it look so smooth but taste so chunky in my mouth34 Needless to say this was quite an adventure for everyone If you39d like to watch the periscope we recorded during the event you can see it on katch Which yogurt looked the best visually There was a 4way tie for the bestlooking yogurt between the following Kite Hill Blueberry Kite Hill Strawberry Kite Hill Vanilla Kite Hill Peach Which yogurt had the best texturemouth feel There was a 3way tie for the best texture between the following Coyo Chocolate Kite Hill Vanilla O39 Soy Vanilla Which yogurt tasted the best The 1 besttasting yogurt in our flavor category was Kite Hill Strawberry The 2 besttasting yogurt was Kite Hill Blueberry The 3 besttasting vegan yogurt was Kite Hill Vanilla Kite Hill was the clear winner by all 4 judges While it was clear that some of us preferred certain Kite Hill flavors over others Kite Hill was the only brand who we all scored highly If you39re interested in knowing who rated the lowest in any category or how a certain variety rated leave a comment below Kite Hill yogurt isn39t organic but they use nonGMO California almonds for all of their products I highly recommend their cream cheese Their almondmilkbased yogurt uses the same probiotic cultures that are used in dairybased yogurts but Kite

suppertime on Christmas eve Native Foods had already closed so we had dinner at a muggle restaurant that had a lot of vegan options It was called Palm Greens Cafe Palm Greens Cafe I liked that you can get your own water because then I can drink the same amount of water as a baby camel without feeling like an alien The ceiling was decorated with pretty colorful paper lanterns to remind you to look up Some of the vegan options on the menu specified Vegan in the name of the item but some items that didn39t specify were still vegan like the Pho All of the desserts were vegan I ordered the Reuben and David ordered the Pho We had tiramisu for dessert Ace Hotel We stayed at the Ace Hotel in Palm Springs which wasn39t my favorite for a number of reasons including but not limited to the following the first room they tried to put us in had a loud machine noise coming from the floor so we had to change rooms the curtains on the windows don39t keep out the sunlight in the morning so we were unable to sleep in the door lock on our front door broke and we had to call maintenance to come and fix it even though our stay was for 2 days our room key stopped working at noon halfway through our stay and we had to go to the lobby to have them fix it the water didn39t drain until your shower was over so you were standing in an inch of your dirty water for the second half of your shower except for me because I39m perfectly clean all the time the housekeeping never came and cleaned between our 2 nights we stayed there There were also good things about the Ace Hotel It39s dog friendly which means you get to pet other people39s dogs when you39re walking around outside There39s even a little dog park They serve Stumptown coffee The pool doesn39t close until 2am and it has a floaty that looks like a donut There are orange trees so you can pick oranges for your breakfast The mimosas they serve at the bar that you can sip poolside are vegan They have brilliantly posted signs The grounds are covered with plants that hummingbirds like so you can make friends with hummingbirds There are outdoor fireplaces you can sit by at night while you crochet socks for your chairs They have lifesized lincoln logs Sticking with tradition we had chinese food for Christmas We went to Supreme Dragon Palm Springs also had gorgeous sunsets Another benefit about the Ace Hotel that I forgot to mention is that Tegan and Sara happened to be spending Christmas there with their family so I got to see them offstage for my first time Native Foods Before leaving Palm Springs we stopped at Native Foods where we met Scotty a friend of Shane39s He39s super sweet and not only does he run this amazing vegan restaurant but he also builds furniture Me and Allium were super excited in the car on the way to Lucerne Valley Trust me this is her excited face Wolf Mountain Sanctuary I had mixed feelings about the wolf sanctuary On one hand I39m really glad that someone exists who can rescue these wolves that would otherwise be euthanized On the other hand it saddened me to see them in cages instead of running around in the desert What do you think about this They would do this really cute thing with their paw when they didn39t want you to stop petting them If you39re like me and just can39t get enough of these cuties here39s the periscope I recorded while I was there Once you39ve already dirven 8 hours to get somewhere driving 2 more doesn39t really seem like a big deal especially when I39m not the one driving haha So we decided to spend a night in LA so we could check out Moby39s new restaurant Little Pine Little Pine Little Pine is a cute small restaurant in an area of LA that has a lot of parking so we had VIP parking right in front Even though we were accidentally early for our reservation they sat us The service was exceptionally friendly and helpful and the food was phenomenal Here39s what we ordered Broccoli Arancini Wild Mushroom Bruschetta Trio of Stuffed Shells The one with olive filling had a pesto sauce the one with spinach filling had a tomato sauce and the one with artichoke filling had a cream sauce Cassoulet PBampJ Banana Split with bruleed bananas peanut butter chocolate chunk and strawberry jam ice cream hot fudge and rice krispie treats It normally comes with meringue but I asked them to hold the aquafaba because I39m not a fan and this is me with a happy tummy taking a picture in their bathroom with the cute pine tree art in the background that looks like a nature scene outside the window I blame the delicious mulled wine for this behavior When we were driving back to the hotel from Little Pine we passed a house that had chandeliers in their front yard tree I don39t know if this is a yearround endeavor or if this is how they celebrate the holidays but I almost knocked on the door with my suitcase in hand to ask them to adopt me "},{"title":"Vegan

store bought tofurky and actually really like the stuffing that the Turtle Island Tofurky has inside of it Even Trader Joe39s had a vegan tofurky this year I have one in my freezer but haven39t actually sampled it yet However as far as I know all of the storebought ones are high in gluten and I have quite a few people in my life who try to avoid eating gluten That is how the birth of the homemade glutenfree tofurkey came about There are basically 3 parts to making this the tofu the stuffing and the marinade I didn39t really use a recipe for the stuffing but it wasn39t glutenfree anyway so hopefully I will post my glutenfree stuffing recipe soon For now if you39re interested in viewing a recipe for stuffing that isn39t glutenfree you can see this one over at Thug Kitchen The

might get too soggy and then press stuffing into the mold inside the tofu Press firmly until mold is filled completely Turn mold over onto an ovensafe pan with sides to bake tofurkey on and tug on the

SeptemberOctober David39s birthday dinner was at an italian restaurant at the Wynn called Bartolotta One of the appetizers on the menu was a chickpea patty cut into triangles and served with a fried caper garnish It was soooo amazing that it made up for the fact that the boys had to go to the mall to buy shirts with collars because of the Wynn restaurants and their stupid ass dresscodes For a few weeks after that dinner I seriously just wanted to make a vat of fried capers and carry them around with me forevermore so I could add them to everything I eat I recovered from that stage and instead decided to try to replicate the recipe at home Chickpea Hearts ingredients 1 c chickpea flour 15 c vegetable broth olive oil Chickpea Hearts directions Make 15 cups of vegetable broth or use packaged I used to buy the Rapunzel bouillon cubes but it was so hard to get them to dissolve that now I buy this huge jar of vegan bouillon paste from Costco I highly recommend it because it39s way easier to work with and tastes delicious The only downside is that it takes up precious room in the fridge and if you39re like me you likely don39t have a square to spare Whisk in 1 cup of chickpea flour slowly

between paper towels Heat the 4 tablespoons of oil in a pan on mediumhigh while capers are drying The benefit of using safflower or sunflower oil over using olive oil is that those oils can withstand

you39re lazy like me and have a kitchenaid to do your dirty work for you While some people really enjoy the task of kneading bread dough I prefer to save my valuable energy for more important things like playing Joust Speaking of whichis it break time Okay I39m back I usually know that it39s kneaded enough when it all starts to stick into a ball and clings to the dough hook Form a ball with the dough and place it into a lightly oiled bowl Cover bowl with a kitchen towel and set in a warm place for 45 minutes to an hour Maybe the dough likes to play hide and seek before you bake it or maybe you don39t want it to dry out while it39s rising I39m 85 sure it39s one of those 2 reasons Here39s the part in the choose your own adventure book where you must make an important decision that could affect the rest of the book Are you going to make a traditional pizza or are you going to be a huge nerd and I cannot believe I39m admitting to this on the world wide web and make a pampered chef tube pizza crust If you chose the first option continue reading from this point If you chose the second option skip to the row of stars and continue reading there Preheat oven to 500 Knead the dough once again Roll the dough into the shape of pizza you would like using a rolling pin and place onto a baking stone Top with sauce and toppings Bake 1015 minutes Remove from oven and let cool Preheat oven to 375 Coat the inside of your bread tube with some sort of oil Have you seen the shape of one of these puppies They dont exactly look like the type of thing you can easily coat with the olive oil and a paper towel method The pampered chef broads probably wanted me to use Pam to spray the inside of this bread tube but luckily I have the hippie version of Pam Spectrum coconut oil spray This stuff is great for hard to reach places that need to be greased I highly recommend getting some if you don39t already have it Separate the dough in half you only need 12 ounces of pizza dough for the bread tube Get out your scale change the switch from grams to ounces because your European boyfriend uses it for measuring the exact amount of coffee and water to use in the chemex every morning and plop what looks like half the dough onto the scale Add or subtract until you get 12 ounces Roll the pizza dough into a log shape and drop it into the tube Bake for 1 hour and then place on a cooling rack The hilarious part is that the instructions that came with this device tell you to always bake this thing vertically I had to do some oven rack rearranging to make room for it and it barely fit even after all that So weird Remove from bread tube once cool and slice Arrange the slices on a baking stone and top with a dollop of pizza sauce Add toppings Bake at 500 for 1015 minutes The water should be around 100110 Im lucky that I have a kettle that tells me the temperature of the water but before that I used to just estimate I never bring food into bathrooms with me I dont even like to bring my

Heat the chocolate chips and coconut milk in a saucepan over low heat stirring often until all chips are almost all the way melted Remove from heat and keep stirring until the ganache is smooth and there are no more lumps Cool the ganache until it39s firm enough to spread between each cake layer When you do this I advise using cake pans that are the same size I used 3 that were the same and one that was slightly larger and in the end my cake didn39t stand up nice and straight as I had hoped I probably also could39ve waited until the ganache thickened a bit more but I39m sort ofwhat do you call it Oh yeah impatient Due to this impatience you don39t get to see a picture of the cake full covered in ganache Sorrryyyyy I39m the worst food blogger everrrrr "},{"title":"Pumpkin Cheesecake
